Getting started reading academic peer-reviewed or pre-print papers can be an intimidating challenge for many learning professionals.  In this post, I'm going to share some advice for getting started.

Most students have a lifetime of experience following a particular textbook for a course.  Most textbooks assume few pre-requisites and state them clearly in the first dozen or so pages.  Prior to publication, a textbook typically goes through many iterations of revision and review.  Even great books will have errata and corrections, but most textbooks serve as a well-guided, curated exploration of a particular topic.

Academic papers, on the other hand, vary wildly in their completeness, correctness, writing style, assumptions, and statement of pre-requisites.  I review several papers from [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) per week and I observe a large standard deviation in the style and rhetoric of the uploaded works.  This is to be expected on a pre-print system which lacks a singular and capable vision for editoral content that a peer-reviewed journal aspires to achieve.  This variance contributes greatly to the barrier to entry for being comfortable reading whitepapers.

First, know that everyone struggles in the early and sometimes intermediate stages of their learning journey.  Like picking up a musical instrument for the first time, learning a second language, or pursuing a particular hobby zelously, the real secret is to consistently dedicate time to active improvement in your abilities.

While all learning is virtuous, you can't expect to absorb the breath of human knowledge in your limited lifetime.  Reading broadly is good to do some of the time, but you should also be thinking about a few specializations or areas of interest.  For example, a broad interest in artificial intelligence is a good interest to have.  But within that, consider selecting one or two subfields that you want to pursue.  For example, deep learning, knowledge graphs, multi-agent systems, or natural language processing.  Even these areas may be too broad for a lifetime of study!

Are you already actively reading papers from time to time?  If not, stop what you are doing right now, visit [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) and find a paper - **any** paper that captures your interest.  Developing this skill, like any other skill, gets the most benefit from regular, repeated effort.  Set a pace to read (or attempt reading!) one paper every *N* days.  Over time, I recommend trying to minimize on *N*.

## Read out of order

I start every paper by reading the abstract, introduction, and then conclusion.  My goal is to determine if I can gain a basic understanding of the problem the paper is contributing to, what other work it relates to that I'm familiar with, and if it's something I'd like to understand.  If the paper describes ideas or terminology I'm not familiar with, it's typically best to go do some independent research on those terms before returning.

If, at this point, there are times when I feel totally lost!  If you've read the abstract, intro, and conclusion and have no idea what the paper's about, fear not.  When I'm in this situation, I commit to setting that paper asside to read later, but before I do, I read all the titles in the references at the end of the paper.  I pick 2 or 3 of those papers that stand out to me and I read those first.

When reading a paper I don't feel initially lost with, my next step is to skim the entire paper quickly.  I read all the section headings.  I look at any data tables or data visualizations and spend time trying to understand them without the context of reading the paper.  Often that's not possible!  But I find the attempt to be very helpful for comprehending the paper when I start my detailed read.

Next begins my detailed read.  I begin a linear read starting with a re-reading of the introduction.  Depending on what I'm trying to understand in a paper, I'll sometimes skill any "related work" section.  While that's an important inclusion for authors to do, I find that if the idea is fairly new to me, the related work might be a distraction worth revisiting later, after I understand the core concepts presented in the paper at hand first.

## Google the paper

Type the title of the paper into google (include authors names if it's vague) and you'd be surprised how frequently there are 5-10 excellent resources waiting for you.  Whether it be an episode of the Data Skeptic podcast or any of the other excellent outlets discussing research in the written or recorded word, it is increasingly common to find walk throughs from people other than the author(s) that can help greatly with your comprehension.

## Visit the authors' website

In my experience, 95% of the authors I google have an academic page which clearly states their research interests in about a paragraph.  Read through the titles of their other publications and see if you can begin to form an image of who this person is and how they think.  Are they a theoretical person or more practical?  Is their background similar to yours?  Might one of their other papers be a better place to start?  Do they have any supplementary materials (videos, slides, blogs) that complement the paper you're reading?

## Discuss with others

If you have an academic advisor, part of their role is to guide you through the process of finding and understanding literature applicable to your research interests.  You need to do the leg work and come prepared with good questions that make the best use of your limited time together.  Having an experience senior person to offer their insight and council is an incredibly valuable resource.

Beyond a formal advisor, you have colleagues, co-workers, friends, and other peers with whom you could organize into a reading group.  A group that all reads the same papers is ideal.  But even causal meetups for open discussion can help you understand the strengths of your peers and to whom you might direct questions or brainstorm ideas as you read about new concepts.

## Take a break

I can't explain the mechanism, but I can confirm from frequent personal experience - walking away form something that seems hard or impenetrable and returning with a fresh mind later can make a world of difference.  Consider trying to write a short paragraph of what you *did* learn or what open questions you have, then taking that break.

## Ask questions online

If you're stuck and can't seem to move forward, find an online resource that works for you.  There are Discord accounts, Slack accounts, Q&A sites, and many other places to post and get feedback.  Keep in mind, all these places have their own cultures and communities.  A good general rule of thumb is to show your appreciation for the person who will answer your question in the future by carefully crafting and re-working your question until it expresses a single, clear, consise question which you think can solicit a useful response to help you move forward.


### Last word

How I read research and what I get out of it has evolved a great deal since I started reading academic white papers as an undergraduate.  Although a bit faded with time, I have a vague but looming memory of the intimidation I felt in the earliest days when I ventured beyond my class textbooks into the papers some of those textbooks referenced or ones suggested by professors.

I've been through many strategies for personal productivity, note taking, and improving comprehension.  My experimentation hasn't yielded any eureka invoking insights.  Exercising the mind is similar to exercising the body.  You need to be consistent and repetitive, pushing yourself a little bit more each time.  The amount time you invest is the true measure of your own returns on that investment.
