# About Qualtrics

Qualtrics is a powerful platform that helps companies understand and improve their customer experience, employee experience, product experience, and brand experience. The platform has extensive features for end-to-end data gathering through surveys and advanced data analysis processes.

Top companies such as Microsoft, Samsung, FedEx, IBM, Forbes, Mastercard, etc use Qaultrics to improve their stakeholders' experience gaps. In this article, we will discuss what Qualtrics does as a company.


## Some Background

Qualtrics was founded in 2002. In 2012, [Sequoia Capital and Accel raised $70 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualtrics) in their Series A funding round. In 2014, these two venture capitals alongside Insight Partner raised another $150 million in funding for Qualtrics, making the company hit a $1 billion valuation. In 2017, Qualtrics launched its experience management platform, making them the pioneer of customer experience management at the time.

Qualtrics was acquired by SAP in November 2018 for $8 billion. It has grown in leaps and bounds ever since, expanding its offerings to virtually everything around experience tracking, measurement, analysis, and improvement.


## The Importance of Experience Management

Experience management is the set of activities an organization performs to quantity and improves the experiences of stakeholders. A stakeholder is not limited to the customers or investors. It could be a third-party vendor, a supplier, or even the employees.

Solid experience management is critical for a business to thrive and stay competitive. It helps companies truly understand how customers perceive their products, their pain points, possible areas of improvement, and so on. With experience management, brands can be sure they are delivering maximum customer satisfaction. This is the recipe for consistent business growth with minimal publicity effort. 

But then, how do experiences be measured? How does Qaultrics help with experience management?  


## Qualtrics Experience Management Workflow



**1. Understand the customer's need**

The first step is to truly understand what your customers need. Qualtrics does this with the [Qualtrics XM Directory (XMD)](https://www.qualtrics.com/xm-directory/). XMD stores every piece of detail from a customer's feedback, and aggregates the result with data from CRM platforms, marketing tools, ticketing software, etc. With the pooled data, it generates a persona for different audiences. You can then understand customer segments better and determine how best to serve them.



**2. Collect data**

Surveys remain an evergreen method of collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Qualtrics Survey builder is used to create and distribute surveys. In fact, many people know Qualtrics as a survey-building company because the Qualtrics Survey builder captures all the features required to collect data from stakeholders adequately.

When creating a survey, you can either use their robust templates for different markets or build yours from scratch. Whichever way you choose, you would then need to curate the survey questions next. The Qualtrics survey software under the [Core XM platform](https://www.qualtrics.com/core-xm/) can assist you in preparing clear questions for tracking a specific parameter. This ensures a question is clear and elicits the intended information. It also reduces the possibility of repeating a question in different ways and improves your response rate.

You have complete flexibility with how the survey questions and answers would look like. You can have answers in free text form, scaled numbers,  multiple-choice, etc.  Qualtrics API also allows you to customize the appearance of your survey with the mainstream programming languages of your choice such as Python, Java, NodeJS, etc.

Having built the survey, the next step is to distribute it. Qualtrics supports different channels to distribute your survey. You can do it via an anonymous link, emails, SMS, social media, etc.



**3. Clean data**

Upon sending out the surveys, the next step is to clean them. A participant may submit a survey more than once because an answer was changed. This can cause duplicate results. A survey may also be incomplete or incorrect. It is thus critical to parse through the survey result and clean them before further analysis.

For online surveys, however, these contingencies can be avoided. You can ensure a participant does not submit a survey more than once but rather edit the answers of a submitted one. You can also ensure compulsory questions are answered before submissions are made. 



**4. Get insight**

The Data & Analysis section is used for this purpose. You can filter a portion of the result, export the data as a CSV, XML, SPSS, or Google Drive file, and perform the analysis outside of Qualtrics. Alternatively, you can perform the analysis on the Qualtrics platform. 

Say you want to understand how your customers would access the durability of your product. You can search for the word ‘durable’ and Qualtrics would filter responses that had the word in them. You can then visualize how often your customers use the word over a span of time. Qualtrics is also capable of sentiment analysis. This helps you quantify how your customers feel about your product; whether positive, negative, or neutral.

[Qualtrics iQ](https://www.qualtrics.com/iq/) takes the data analysis a step further. iQ is a completely automated tool that parses survey results, applies machine learning algorithms, and provides actionable recommendations. iQ can work with free texts, numbers, audio, etc. You can turn phone conversations into valuable insights or understand the actions that cause the biggest customer engagement 24/7. 



**5. Take action**

The final step in experience management is to take action. After identifying actions for a better stakeholder experience, you can set triggers that activate the action when a condition is satisfied. This can be achieved with [xFlow](https://www.qualtrics.com/xflow/). xFlow can also be integrated into existing tech stack in the organization such as HubSpot, Jira, Zendesk, Salesforce, and so on.

In addition, the survey results may recommend designing another process or service. It may also reveal an untapped opportunity in the business. [Design XM](https://www.qualtrics.com/design-xm/) provides the tools to recreate and design new experiences that encourage growth and optimal stakeholder experiences.
