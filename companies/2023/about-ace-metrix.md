# About Ace Metrix

Measuring the impact of an ad is not a walk in the park. It requires careful analysis benchmarked against critical persuasion components such as attention, likeability, relevance, etc. All these factors will determine whether a video ad would hit its mark. In this article, we shall discuss one of the major players in video ads analytics — Ace Metrix. We shall discuss what they do and take a deeper dive into how they quantitatively and qualitatively measure video ad impact.


## Some background on Ace Metrix

Ace Metrix is a digital and television ad analytics company. The company helps brands measure the impact of their ads from the conceptual stage to the airing stage. This is done by sending a survey to 500 potential videos and receiving quick feedback on the ad. The results of the survey are then analyzed based on relevant parameters and its overall performance is quantified on a scale of 0 to 950.

Ace Metrix was founded in 2007 by JuYoung Lee and Steve Goldman. In June 2009, they began their ad measuring solution. Ace Metrix has since worked with top brands such as Google, P&G, Amazon, T-Mobile, etc to test their digital and television ad videos and measure their impact. In January 2021, Ace Metrix was acquired by iSpot.tv, a company known for measuring the reach and conversion rates of TV ads for every second.


## How Ace Metrix Measures the Impact of Video Ads

Surveys are the backbone of analyzing the impact of video ads. When a new ad is released, Ace Metrix technologies are deployed to first confirm that the ad is new. Afterward, a standardized survey is sent to 500 potential viewers on the initial impression of the ad. Within 24 hours, the Ace Metrix LIVE software platform analyzes the responses and provides insights about how the ad will perform. This process is called the creative assessment. 

The survey results are classified into two: quantitative and qualitative. To quantify the impact of the ad, they analyze the survey based on seven components:



* **Watchability**: Measures the possibility of the viewer watching the ad multiple times.
* **Information**: Measures how well the content of the ad was well communicated.
* **Change**: Measures how well the viewer can have a change of thought on the product/brand.
* **Desire**: Measures how well the viewer wants the product after viewing the ad
* **Relevance**: Measures how well the product is relevant to the viewer.
* **Likability**: Measures whether the viewer likes the ad.
* **Attention**: Measure the attention span of the viewer throughout the ad.

These seven metrics are then pushed to a proprietary algorithm to release the popular Ace Score measured on a 0 - 950 scale.

In addition to this, Ace Metric stores a repository of ads across various industries in the US. They receive more than 20,000 data points from each ad and have analyzed over 115,000 ads from 4,300+ brands. This enables them to benchmark an ad against its competitors and provide a prediction of its performance based on historical trends. 

Ace Metrix also measures qualitative data. The survey questions contain open-ended questions that elicit general comments from the viewer alongside some behavioral questions. The answers to these questions are analyzed verbatim using natural processing language (NLP) algorithms to investigate the words that are most prevalent. 

A simplistic example would be a situation where many comments contain the word ‘cinematic’. It would be obvious that the viewers find the ad cinematic, and thus may increase the attention and likeability score of the ad. The qualitative results shed light on what is in the mind of the viewers after watching the ads. As a general rule of thumb, they can explain why an ad has its Ace Score from the quantitative analysis.

Beyond identifying which words are prevalent in the viewers' comments, qualitative data also measure the emotional connection of viewers. Here’s the thing. Emotions are at the core of the success of any ad. An ad that cannot invoke emotions has failed on arrival. Ace Metrix thus measures how well an ad emotionally connects with the viewers using NLP algorithms. They rank an ad based on 57 metrics such as boring, inspiring, authentic, clear, cool, funny, awful, and so on. 


## Video Analytics Across the Pipeline

Ace Metrix analytics can be split into two stages. 



**1. Pre-market ad testing**

Ace Metrix helps brands minimize the risk of airing a less impactful ad but iteratively testing the ad before it is officially released. The creative assessment is done to identify how potential consumers perceive the ad and areas for possible improvements. The same survey questions are sent to 500 unique viewers who would give their take on the ad's impact.

In the pre-market stage, brands can tweak the survey questions to fit into their pre-testing goals. This way, they iterate for multiple goals, changing the questions based on the demographic, behavioral, and psychographic components.



**2. In-market ad testing**

After the pre-market ad testing is complete and the ad officially releases, Ace Metrix performs the creative assessment process within 24 hours. This reassures the brands that their ad resonates with their intended audience based on their specific parameters. 

Here, they also measure how well the airing ad meets the initial campaign goals. They finally receive qualitative feedback on the ad and identify possible improvements for future ads.

Beyond these two forms of ad testing, Ace Metrix also performs short-form ad analytics. Short-form ads are ads of 11 seconds or less. They are quickly growing in popularity because of the reduced attention span of younger generations. Short videos can also be analyzed to ensure that they reach the right people, they are shown at the right time, and they pass the right message.


## Wrapping up

Ace Metrix is a global leader in video ads analytics. But as seen in this article, surveys form the foundation for their qualitative and quantitative analysis. Combined with a large database of previous high-performing ads and carefully trained NLP models, they can develop a score that measures how impactful an ad is on its target audience.
