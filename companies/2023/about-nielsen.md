# About Nielsen

Nielsen is a global market research company. They are best known for the Nielsen ratings — a trusted audience measurement system for newspaper, radio, and TV audiences. This article will discuss what Nielson does, what makes them stand out, and how they perform market research.


## Some Background about the Company

[Nielsen was established in 1923 by Arthur C. Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Corporation) and was at the time called ACNielsen. They provided market research consultancy for companies by conducting research and surveys on consumer goods and the media. The simple business model was to collect, analyze, and sell data to companies that require them.

In 1936, they started measuring radio audiences by collecting data on what listeners listen to, when they listen, for how long they listen, and what they love listening to. They connected a device called an Audimeter to [1000 households](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/nielsen-what-people-watch-what-people-buy/) which measured dials made by the listener. This information was sent back to Nielsen for analysis. The data was used to measure the viewing habit of listeners and it birthed the popular “Neilsen ratings” we know today.

In 1950, Nielsen expanded to measuring TV audiences using a similar approach. They connected measuring devices to selected TVs across various households as usual. In 1953, they added another form of data collected. They started sending diaries to a smaller number of households. The diary was a survey that collected information about the station the household watched, the name of the program they saw, and at what time. Augmenting both results provided a more robust demographic analysis of who watches what.

In July 2008, Nielsen released a report detailing how online video audiences are beginning to blow up. In September 2016, they had an official rating for digital content.  


## Nielsen’s Reporting Segment

Nielsen’s operation can be classified into three reporting segments:



**1. Buy**

This segment is involved in measuring consumer behavior. They do this by collecting market data of fast-moving consumer goods, retail data, and store data. The data helps their clients (companies and other retailers) understand the products and brands consumers buy. In 2012, [Nielsen was measuring sales in over 18 million physical stores](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/n/NYSE_NLSN_2012.pdf) across the globe and was already represented in 100 countries. 

They also have panel data about the item a household buys over a period of time. By merging both data, Nielsen is able to estimate the buying behavior and product loyalty of customers. The ultimate objective is to provide key insights to companies on their target audience, helping them maximize ROI on new products or product features.



**2. Watch**

The media plays an important role in what we buy. This is why advertisers pay billions of dollars yearly to media houses for ad placements. Nielsen’s Watch segment focuses on measuring what consumers watch across various devices. While they started with traditional TVs, they have expanded to other digital channels such as the use of smartphones, laptops, tablets, and gaming consoles. 

Nielsen’s media consumption measurement index is called Reach. Reach measures how many people see programming, how many people see ads, and how frequently they see them. 



**3. Market**

Since Nielsen measures what consumers watch and buy, they can combine this information to understand what consumers purchase after an ad. This gives them a holistic view of the market. Nielsen’s Market involves understanding the market dynamics and guiding companies on the best strategies to improve their market position. Companies can better understand how ad expenses affect consumers’ purchases. 


## How Market Research is Done

Market research involves gathering market data, analyzing it, finding trends in the market, predicting competitors' moves, and making an informed decision from the results. The goal is to better understand the consumers and what they really need. This information is useful for companies who wish to launch a new product or improve their existing products. 

Surveys are one of the most popular ways to collect quantitative data. To date, Neisen still sends consumer surveys to households with some cash incentives. Here are three steps involved in conducting a survey.



**1. Preparing survey questions**

Here, the questions to be asked in the survey are thought of. This is a critical part as the wrong survey questions can mar the survey results. The questions should clearly focus on the information you are seeking to elicit.



**2. Survey distribution**

After the survey questionnaires have been prepared, you’d need to decide on the sample size to work with and randomly select households that would participate in the survey. One thing to note is that large sample size does not necessarily mean better survey results. With just 1000 households, Nielsen was able to provide an accurate Neilsen rating for radio audiences in the US.



**3. Survey analysis**

This is where the complex data is aggregated and analyzed. It would require a mix of soft and hard skills. It goes without saying that strong analytical skills are required. This would be important in guiding your decision on what to do with the data. Also, critical thinking skills are vital. Sometimes, the data may contain an invalid or false entry. You’d need to question your results to ensure they are reasonable.

Beyond that, there is a need for good communication skills. An analysis is worth nothing when it cannot be communicated clearly and concisely. You should be able to represent your findings to the client through visualizations and dashboards and good storytelling.


## How Nielsen Collects Consumer Data

As explained earlier, Nielsen collects data through surveys. But they collect data on FCMGs sales by [going to physical stores of retail stores around the world](https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2016/how-does-nielsen-collect-and-analyze-data/). A Neilsen retail auditor goes to the physical store daily to keep trade of stock inventory and sales. This is done across different countries in the world. In areas where electronic tracking is not used, Nielsen auditors use a scanner to capture retail sales across various retail stores.

Nielsen auditors also [visit households after a purchase](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/02/a-quick-guide-to-what-you-dont-know-about-data-collection-UG2NCPS.pdf). They scan products that have been bought alongside receipts to keep track of stores where the goods were bought. At a later time, the auditor returns to the same household. This time, the auditor checks the dustbin and ticks off items that have already been consumed. This allows them to determine how quickly a product is consumed.


### Wrapping up

Neilsen is one of the leading market research firms in the world. By leveraging media consumption data as well as retail data, they are able to understand the consumer market and serve their clients with actionable business insights to thrive. Surveys are a great way of gathering quantitative data. However, there may also be a need to have workers physically measure the consumption rate of consumer goods. Nielsen also measures how people watch digital content on radios, TVs, smartphones, etc. 

Wielding these datasets, Nielsen is able to provide global market research for companies.
