# Understanding the Polling Industry

According to [reports](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/press-release/public-opinion-and-election-polling-market-2022), the public opinion and election polling industry have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6%. The market has reported growth from $7.54 billion in 2021 to $8.04 billion in 2022 and is poised at reaching $9.9 billion by 2026. This lofty trajectory begs questions. How has the polling industry become so huge? Are polls truly significant? What are the big players in the industry doing? In this article, we will attempt to answer these questions. We’d use Gallup as a case study and identify as they have grown in leaps and bounds over the years. 


## Why are polls increasingly useful?

Opinion polls are particularly used in elections, although they can be useful for brands as well. During election periods, they help government officials understand how the public perceives their policies and evaluate their person. This index is important, especially in a democratic system where the people’s opinion is all that matters.

The internet age has increased the importance of opinion polls. It is now easier for people to express their opinion in public and when this is done en masse, the results are indeed consequential. While taking the opinion of a single person is as good as useless, the opinion of a group of people when aggregated passes a message.

Opinion poll results from a large sample can also be used to change others’ decisions in one's favor.  It is said that people tend to vote for someone they think is most likely to win. This is called the bandwagon effect. This is why government officials spend a lot of money on opinion polls. They do not just to have a glimpse of whether they stand a chance at the election, but to also reveal the potential support they already have.

Opinion polls started in 1824 when Harrisburg Pennsylvania created a local straw poll for the Jackson Adams election. Since then, it has grown in sophistication and volume. Today, there are several opinion polls companies generating millions of dollars in revenue. To understand this evolution, let’s look at the story of Gallup.


## The Emergence of Gallup

George Gallup was the founder of Gallup Inc, formerly known as the American Institute of Opinion. While working in an advertising firm called Young & Rubicam, he helped in quantifying their radio audience. He also did some election forecasting activities there. But Gallup got his hands dirty when he created a poll that revealed his mother-in-law was going to win Iowa’s Secretary of State position in 1932. She did. That experience cemented Gallup’s interest in election polls. 

In 1935, he founded the American Institute of Opinion. His organization was then shot into the limelight when he accurately predicted Franklin Roosevelt's election victory in 1936. Being a pioneer of public opinion polls, Gallup Inc. has made giant strides since then.

One thing that made Gallup’s poll relevant was its sheer accuracy. Gallup prides itself on a 100% prediction accuracy in polling results from 1936 to 2008 excluding results from the 1948 election and 1976 election.

Having made its mark in election polls, Gallup spread their tentacles and diversified to other fields. They now conduct global workplace analysis, American mood research, health surveys, various private and public sector surveys, and so on. In 2016, the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-jobless-picture-offers-room-for-interpretation-1469577415) compared Gallup’s statistics on unemployment with the result from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They found out that both results were similar and the trends were correlated. Considering that BLS had a much larger sample space, this further cemented the integrity of Gallup’s survey methods. 


## How Gallup creates polls.

The most important ingredient for a successful poll is the selected sample. A sample is simply an empirical abstraction of a population. With a properly selected sample, we can make inferences about a population. It’s the same way you do not need to taste an entire pot of soup to determine how it tastes. A taste from a portion gives a good idea if the soup was properly stirred.

Gallup takes special care in determining their samples. They use a principle called probability sampling. The principle of probability sampling simply says that a small fraction of a population can represent the opinions of the entire population if they are correctly selected. In other words, we do not have to interview everybody before we can make generalizations about the population. 

In ensuring they select a good sample, Gallup uses another principle called the equal probability of selection. This states that every member of a population must have an equal or known probability to be selected for a drawn sample to be representative. This way, they can be randomly selected.

During the random selection, they ensure every cross-section of the population is represented. Some of their considerations include gender, location, race, political affiliation, race, age, and so on. In the early days, Gallup conducted door-to-door polls, capturing the nook and cranny of America's homes. In the 1980s however, it became more difficult to conduct physical interviews. For one, Americans were reluctant to allow strangers into their homes. Secondly, the cost was increasing exponentially.

They then shifted to interviewing respondents via landlines in the 1980s, and in the late 2000s, they shifted to mobile phones considering that a large chunk of Americans had mobile phones.

Gallup ensures that its target population is well-defined before random sampling is done. Say, for instance, they want to create a poll assessing the opinions of baseball lovers. The target population may be all individuals aged 12 and above that watch baseball for 12 hours daily. Once this is defined, the next step is random sampling. They randomly scramble phones through a complicated process to generate the numbers. Their sample size is typically between 1000 to 1500. 

Contrary to popular belief, an increased sample size may not necessarily cause a significant increase in accuracy. Given that the principle of equal probability of selection is followed, a sample of 1000 is enough to make an inference. Finally, Gallup applies sample weighting to ensure that some demography of the population is not overrepresented while some others are underrepresented.

Gallup’s margin of error is typically 4%. In other words, if they decided to interview the entire US population, their sample result may be a 4% increase or decrease from the population result.

In 2005, Gallup began world surveys and they have conducted polls in over 160 countries. They use virtually the same methodology to identify their samples. Interviewing respondents however changes slightly, depending on the country. In developed countries, they randomly generate phone numbers while in developing countries, they randomly select households for face-to-face interviews.


## Other Survey-based Companies

There are other survey companies that have sprung up since the American Institute of Opinion, now called Gallup, was founded in 1935. I randomly selected some of them here.



* Ipsos: Ipsos is a research company founded in 1975. Ipsos does not only focus on election polls, however. They also do market research and try to understand society using concrete metrics and so on. Ipsos basically help businesses solve business problems through market strategy and understanding, innovation, user experience analysis, channel performance, etc. Ipsos widely uses data analytics skills to elicit data and convert them into actionable insights for brands.
* Selzer & Company: Selzer & Company is an election polling company that focuses on elections in the state of Iowa. It was founded in 1992 and has grown to become a renowned polling firm in Iowa. They largely use telephones to reach respondents and after the interview, use weights to account for over and undersampling. As of March 25th, 2021, Selzer has FiveThirtyEight's Pollster Ratings of A+. 
* JMC analytics and polling: JMC was founded in 2010 by John Couvillon, a Data Analyst by training. They also do election polling in Louisiana. JMC uses a combination of three methods to conduct its polls. First, they use the traditional physical interview session. They also use telephones to reach their respondents. Lastly, they send their respondents polling questions through text. According to FiveThirtyEight, they have a rating of B/C.
* Trafalgar group: Trafalgar is a polling company based in Atlanta Georgia. They have had some outstanding accuracy over the years. For instance, they were the only company that predicted Trump’s victory in Michigan and Pennsylvania in the 2016 election. They do not only use traditional scientific methods for their polls but add a bit of psychology. Trafalgar utilized several methods to conduct their polls including emails, live phone calls, text messages, voice responses, and other digital methods they kept private.  According to FiveThirtyEight, they have an A- rating.


## Conclusion

Polls have been increasingly important for businesses, politicians, and the people alike. But whether they should be trusted is still a subjective question. Like every other statistical forecasting problem, there is no 100% guarantee that it would turn as predicted. However, they tend to be true the majority of the time. While we shouldn’t take poll results hook, line, and sinker, history has shown us that there is usually some element of truth in them.
