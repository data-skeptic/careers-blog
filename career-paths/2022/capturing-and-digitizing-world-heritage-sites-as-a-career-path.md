# Capturing and Digitizing World Heritage Sites as a Career Path

In 2015, we [<ins>interviewed</ins>](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2015/preserving-history-at-cyark) Elizabeth Lee, VP of Programs and Development at CyArk. CyArk is a non-profit organization on a mission to capture and digitize world heritage sites. With the proliferation of VR technologies such as the Metaverse, digitizing physical assets is arguably one of the next big things in the tech space.

In this article, we will dissect the technology behind digitizing physical objects in 3D and pathways to launching a career in that niche.

## What is CyArk About?

As earlier mentioned, CyArk aims to preserve world heritage sites by transforming them into 3D images. According to Elizabeth, CyArk also allows users to connect with other cultures. She said, “CyArk’s goal of recording historical sites is to not only share the rich history of the human race but to better connect people to the world around them.” You can literally engage and interact with historical sites without traveling thousands of miles. 

Over the years, they have gone to more than 185 sites scattered all over the world. Some of the visited and digitized sites include:

* Un Viaje por el Qhapaq Nan in Ecuador, Peru
    
* St. James AME Zion Church in the US
    
* Waitangi in New Zealand
    
* Lukang Longshen Temple in Taiwan
    
* Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico
    
* Ayuthaya in Thailand
    
* Gateway of India in India
    
* Busanyin Shrine, Osun in Nigeria, and so on.
    

With Tapestry, CyArk’s specially built platform, you can learn about the stories of these cultural sites in an immersive 3D experience on your mobile devices. [<ins>Visit their website to take a virtual tour with Tapestry</ins>](https://www.cyark.org/whatwedo/).

## How Physical Objects are Digitized

There are a couple of technologies involved in recreating monuments and heritage sites virtually. Each of them with its specific function. The two most important ones are:

### 1.  LiDAR technology
    

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is the major technology for capturing objects digitally. The technology works by sending lasers to the structure to be scanned. When the laser beam hits the object, it is reflected back towards the source. The distance of each point on the object to the LiDAR sensor — and by extension the shape of the object — is found by calculating the time it takes for the laser beam to hit the object (called pulse) and to be reflected back (called return). Since the LiDAR technology sends lasers across an entire landscape, if the laser beam takes a longer time to be reflected back, it indicates the presence of edges and contours. LiDAR gives an accurate picture of the shape and dimension of a structure in 3D. It is however important to note that LiDAR does not capture the color of the object. The next technology to be discussed will.

### 2.  Photogrammetry
    

Photogrammetry is the use of digital photographs to make measurements. It works by taking pictures from different angles and observing the distance between some predefined reference points. In order to accurately measure the relative distance between the reference point, certified scale bars are placed on the object. The distance between the reference points at different angles is called point clouds. When the point clouds are merged from various images, they can be holistically reconstructed to create a 3D image of entire structures. This technology is widely used in Google Earth and Google Maps.

Photogrammetry is useful in digitizing world historic sites as it can convert conventional pictures into crisp 3D images while capturing their color and texture.

## How to Get into a this Field

If this field excites you, having a background in any of the following gives you an opportunity to practice.

### 1.  Anthropology and Geography
    

This should not come as a surprise. You will generally be working with ancient structures, requiring the need for anthropology. A program in anthropology teaches you to understand human culture and development over the years. You better understand what has shaped us in the past and how it connects us now. The CyArk team definitely would require a strong knowledge of anthropology to determine the sites worthy of digitization. 

A background in geography comes in handy when exploring sites and cultural spaces. You’d also have strong navigation skills which are imperative in finding new sites and locating them from a bird’s eye view.

A degree in Anthropology and geography does not only give you the opportunity to work in a company like CyArk, you can also work in museums, preservation centers, national parks, wildlife parks, environmental protection societies, etc.

### 2.  Ecology and Environmental Biology
    

Historical heritages are not just non-living objects, detached from the rest of the world. Like every other thing on here, they are affected by biological factors such as rain, climate change, microorganism activities, and so on. Having a background in ecology and environmental biology makes you understand how biology, nature, and cultural heritages tie together. You also understand how structures are preserved for decades despite prevalent biological activities.

### 3.  Material Studies
    

It is not just enough to get a site’s picture, a good understanding of the material is needed to capture its texture. A degree in material studies teaches you how to work with different kinds of materials such as wood, glass, fibers, clay, metal, metals, etc. You’d most likely take hands-on courses in imaging, drawing of natural forms, art history, computers for making objects, history of crafts, and professional practices. 

### 4.  Architecture
    

Architecture is a broad field that involves the construction of complex structures. A typical degree in architecture will offer courses in areas such as landscape design, building conservation, urban, rural and regional planning, route design, and so on. All these come into play when connecting the reference points from the photogrammetry data and converting the same to a single 3D masterpiece. 

### 5.  Visual communication design
    

This field teaches you how to use colors, symbols, images, and movement to pass on a compelling story. It goes beyond the basic graphic design to using subtle elements to invoke a particular emotion, educate or persuade an audience. Such attention to details in design is critical when digitizing historical structures. The minutest objects in the sites are not ignored, but rather projected to the audience. A program in visual communication design would include courses such as figure drawing, art history, advanced visualization, etc. If you do not want to become an environmental graphic designer, you can also choose to be an interaction designer, animator, experience designer, motion designer, game designer, etc. These are unique career paths with specific use cases.

### 6.  Animation and visual effects (VFX)
    

In order to make the VR experience as real as possible, a strong background in animation and visual effects is fundamental. The program teaches 3D modeling, rendering, texture shading, color and composition, motion graphics, storytelling, etc. All these help users have an immersive experience in the virtual world. 

### 7.  Digital arts
    

This is closely knitted with visual communication design but focuses on digital tools for the new media. You will learn about lighting, 3D sculpting, audiovisual productions, color science, digital interactions and so on. 

### 8.  Database management and data science
    

As you may have guessed, a career in heritage site digitization will involve a large collection of data for further processing. The database engineer helps to store and query the data, while the data scientist converts the data into tangible insights. Data science also intersects with communication and storytelling which is vital in sharing a narrative.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed the technologies used in creating a realistic digital image of heritage sites. You also discovered learning programs that can open up opportunities to delve into this field. Before you get started, I’d advise that you first ensure that the career paths interest you. Once that is established, the opportunities for success are limitless.
