# An Introduction to Computational Transportation Science (CTS)

Computational transportation science (CTS) is an emerging field that involves planning and modeling transport systems by analyzing large streams of data. The aim is to ensure seamless pedestrian and vehicular movement by exploiting real-time data from sensors and powerful computing from processors.

This article will give an introduction to what CTS is about, its benefits, and the major drivers of this field.


## What is Computational Transportation Science?

CTS is a merger of both computer science and transportation science. In computer science, it utilizes the aspect of distributed computing and real-time information processing. In transportation science, on the other hand, it utilizes the aspect of transportation management and control. 

CTS studies transportation systems in different forms. It could study how humans interact with systems, as in a driver interfacing with their self-driving car. It can also study how systems measure traffic. For example, when interpreting crowdsourced traffic situations in an area. Also, it can check how systems manage traffic, like traffic light systems.

Ultimately, CTS focuses on improving the safety, efficiency, sustainability, and mobility of transport systems.


## Benefits and Applications of CTS

While the field is still in its infancy, there is a wide range of areas CTS can be beneficial.



* An efficient vehicular movement: Traffic jams are one of the major challenges with traditional transportation systems. With Computational transportation science, data from vehicle and road sensors can be used to provide local and decentralized data computation for tailor-suited traffic advisory. This is advantageous for the drivers ( in reduced fuel cost), for the infrastructure (reduced traffic congestion), and for the environment (reduced pollution from fuel).
* Proper planning of infrastructural development/maintenance: Traffic infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and tunnels are prone to wear out. Hence, there is a need for consistent maintenance. With more interconnected data about the use of infrastructures per time, efficient planning of maintenance activities can be done. CTS can also help engineers determine the most appropriate infrastructure to build in a location to solve specific transportation challenges. 
* The use of virtual infrastructure: By getting real-time data of road situations, virtual lanes can replace the current physical lanes we have. In this case, lanes with more traffic can be larger than lanes with smaller traffic at different times of the day. In addition, road signs which are prone to change can be virtual and thus dynamic. This includes traffic lights, construction signs, warning signs, etc.
* Better driver assistance: CTS can be used to better assist the driver. A driver can be warned about an oncoming vehicle in their driver when leaving their lane. In times where there is low visibility, driving-assisted features in the vehicle can be used to produce accurate information about traffic situations up ahead.


## The Drivers of CTS

There are some technologies that have skyrocketed the advance of Computational Transportation Science today. They include:



1. **Sensor data**: Currently, transportation situations are mostly gotten from human sensory organs (the eyes and the ears). But it is difficult to store and transmit such data electronically. If CTS must advance, there has to be an increase in the use of sensors in both vehicles and road infrastructures. This would serve as the basis for generating real-time data for further computation. 
2. **Decentralized computing**: When you request for the traffic situation up ahead, your query is sent to a centralized server and the result is gotten by polling vehicles ahead of you. However, this poses a challenge. Because the network IDs of the vehicles are unknown, it is difficult to determine where the relevant data to answer your query resides and how to retrieve it. 

    In decentralized computing, however, the map data is stored in individual vehicles and when a query is made, polling does not necessarily need to be done. The required result is simply communicated from the vehicle ahead that holds the relevant data.


    In other words, decentralized computing allows for direct communication with vehicles, rather than relying on a central source that aggregates results before returning the query request. Decentralized computing also makes scaling possible and makes the system less prone to failure.

3. **Social computing**: Social computing involves the collection of data from a crowd and using that information to extrapolate traffic situations. In this contact, a crowd could involve road users, the government, transportation providers, and so on. Social computing helps in determining what the majority of people say about the traffic situation. The result can then be used to create a personalized advisory for a traveler looking to ply that same road. 

    Social computing in CTS still however has questions that beg for answers. First, how can data be collected? This may involve the proliferation of sensors in cars and road networks. Beyond that, the question of how data is shared becomes important. The lifeblood of social computing is in the sustainability of individuals sharing their data. Why then should a user keep sharing their data? What are the incentives for sharing your data? Also, the question of data quality and privacy concerns is critical. There has to be an assurance that there are no calibration errors from a data source and private information of users is not let out. 



## Conclusion

Computational transportation system still has room for growth, but the outlook is optimistic. The use of more sensors on our roads and in vehicles is simply sowing the seeds for a more robust computational transportation science.
