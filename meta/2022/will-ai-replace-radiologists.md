# Will AI Replace Radiologists?

In 2016, Professor Geoffrey Hinton, who is considered a pioneer of neural networks, said that we should stop training radiologists because AI models will perform better than them in five years. It’s been 5 years now and things are not quite looking as planned. In this article, we will dissect the issue of AI replacing the jobs of radiologists. Specifically, we’d look at the reaction of a radiologist, Dr Curtis P. Langlotz, published in a paper, [Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Radiologists?](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2019190058). 

## What do Radiologists do?

A radiologist is a medical specialist who diagnoses diseases using medical imaging such as X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, etc. It sounds simple but it requires a lot of practice and experience. According to Dr Curtis Langlotz, a radiologist works with almost [20,000 lists of disorder terminologies and over 50,000 lists of possible causes](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/rg.341135036). While the advent of AI can augment the efforts of radiologists, it would be false to conclude that it can replace the job of an experienced radiologist, who can find several conditions from a medical image.

Most of the machine learning models, on the other hand, were trained to identify a single condition. They also are trained on common diseases such as breast cancer, brain tumor and pneumonia. A human radiologist delves deeper to detect uncommon diseases. Moreso, the unabundant sample datasets for uncommon diseases would be a bottleneck for training machine learning models.

## Is this Becoming Stale News for Radiologists?

The news of AI replacing radiologists has been on for a long time. In 1896, when the first MRI devices were produced, some were quick to predict the end of radiologists. This was because, at the time, there was a sharp contrast between MRIs of healthy images and the ones with conditions. It was predicted that at worst, primary health workers would be capable of interpreting the results. But as time progressed, reality dawned. It was discovered that the machines required complex configurations for the appropriate image for diagnosis to be produced. The configurations required the expertise of a radiologist. 

In addition, there was legislation for additional funding for [computer-aided models](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/415996) in the 90s to detect breast cancer from mammograms. At the time, many radiologists purchased these computer-aided systems. The result was an array of false positives. In other words, the system predicted patients had breast cancer when they did not. Looking in retrospect, the news of AI replacing radiologists in this decade mirrors the 90s situation. As Dr Curtis put it, the past failure of these CAD tools should cause for introspection and caution.

## On Job Displacement

Radiologists have not been the only career path marked for doom due to technological advancement. Career paths such as accountants, cashiers, factory workers, and even programmers have been said to be replaced by AI. But the reality today is far from these predictions. Despite the proliferation of ATMs in the early 2000s, the number of bank tellers has grown from [60,000 in 1985 to over 638,000 in 2018](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/06/15/are-atms-stealing-jobs). According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/home.htm), production occupations (including factory workers) are expected to show little or no loss of jobs from 2020 to 2030. Accountants' employment is expected to grow by [7% from 2020 to 2030](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm#:~:text=in%20May%202021.-,Job%20Outlook,on%20average%2C%20over%20the%20decade.).

The same thing can be said for radiology. Rather than replacing radiologists' jobs, AI and the advancement of technology will only increase the number of job openings. There is currently a [shortage of radiologists](https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/are-we-prepared-for-a-looming-radiologist-shortage-#:~:text=This%20shortage%20is%20also%20projected,pathologists%2C%20and%20psychiatrists%20by%202033.) in the US that is projected to worsen. This shows that not only has AI failed to replace radiologists, the number of practicing radiologists cannot keep up with the amount of emerging studies needed in hospitals.

## AI will be of Help

In the paper Dr. Curtis published, he described the relationship between AI and radiologists as the one between pilots and a plane’s autopilot. Autopilot has been for a long, getting more sophisticated year in year out. They complement the efforts of pilots particularly during regular flights. However, pilots are still needed to fly a plane. They are especially needed when a sensor malfunctions or during critical in-flight situations.

In the same vein, AI will help radiologists identify regular and non-urgent conditions such as plotting the organ volume vs normal range graph or measuring the time course of liver metastases. However, it cannot replace the radiologists' judgment, and creativity that has been gathered from several years of training and experience. 

## The Two can and should Work Together

It is without doubt that AI systems will create efficiency in repetitive tasks such as scanning for bone-health conditions, mammography screening, analyzing color fundus photos (CFPs) for diabetes retinopathy, etc. They will also help in discovering conditions that require urgent attention. But they cannot completely replace radiologists. In the end, harmonizing human-machine interaction is the best shot and is definitely better than cherry-picking one at the expense of the other. AI and radiologists can co-exist.
