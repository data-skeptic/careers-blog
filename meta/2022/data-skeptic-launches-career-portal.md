## Data Skeptic Launches Career Portal

I'm pleased to announce we're launching [careers.dataskeptic.com](https://careers.dataskeptic.com) today as a portal for job seekers to get advice, hear other people's stories, and explore new opportunities.

Over the last 8 years, we've regularly run listener surveys on the Data Skeptic podcast to learn more about who are listeners are, what they like, and what they don't like.  There are many themes and insights we've drawn from aggregating our respondents.  One topic that is consistently mentioned is that our listeners are often young professionals (young in their careers, though not necessarily in age) who are on a learning journey in an effort to keep momentum on their career.

We knew our listenership was filled with curious learners, but we underestimated how many rated themselves as "in the market" or at least curious about following it.  Creating a destination site of regular blog posts related to career growth is a natural extension for what we do with the podcast.  I look forward to featuring a variety of professionals in career profile posts which help tell the story of how they got where they are today.  Similarly, I think we can become a good resource for what tools, technologies, languages, and methods are active in industry so that job seekers can better prepare to achieve success in new roles.

Lastly, adding a job search function to our portal opens a unique opportunity for Data Skeptic.  When interviewing industry professionals, there's often a boundary the guest is unwilling to cross in describing the functionality of their systems too precisely.  Sometimes this is a smart strategy to keep some novel aspect of the work a trade secret.  More often, I believe it's smoke and mirrors to avoid explaining the gap between the implementation and the visionary way it was described.  But if the platform is owned by Data Skeptic, then I can draw these lines broadly and share deep details about the precise ways in which we optimize our site.  The ability to deeply about practical situations on the podcast using the data from our own platform is a new direction that has me very excited about the content we can produce in the future.

Whether you're looking for a job or simply keeping up with the industry, I hope you find our new venture to be a useful resource.  Either way, tweet at us and let me know what you think!

Thanks!

Kyle
