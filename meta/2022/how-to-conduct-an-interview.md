An interview is perhaps the most important step in the hiring process. It gives you, the hiring manager, an opportunity to have a one-on-one interaction with the candidate and determine whether they are the right fit for you. But conducting an interview is not a walk in the park. Like every other activity, it requires preparation and an understanding of the rules to make the best out of it. In this article, you will discuss how to conduct a successful job interview. Let’s dive in.

## Before the Interview Day

As earlier mentioned, it is important to adequately prepare before the day of the interview. Here are some important things to do before meeting with the candidate.

1.  ## Be clear on what you want
    

Before the interview, you should know the persona of your ideal candidate. You do this by identifying the skills required for the job and noting them down. Some soft skills may also be required for the job.Having a clear picture of the skills you need helps you weed out unqualified candidates quite easily. 

If you are expanding an existing team in your organization, a good way to identify a great candidate is to mirror the attributes of the best performing team members. This way, you know the new hire would blend into the team without any hassles. Remember, your primary reason for hiring is to find the best fit for you and your organization.

Skills needed could be classified into two: the required skills and nice-to-have skills. While candidates without the nice-to-have skills can be trained on the job, candidates without the required skills can be easily weeded out.

2.  ## Review the resume
    

You need to block out time to review the resume of candidates that have been called up for an interview. This allows you to have an idea of who the candidate is before meeting them. You do not want to face a candidate and ask questions that are blatantly stated in the resume.

While reviewing the resume beforehand, make sure to highlight points that catch your attention and require further discussion during the interview.

3.  ## Note down some key questions
    

During the interview, you do not want to miss out on some critical questions. You can avoid this by noting down questions that must be asked across the board. For example, if you are recruiting a backend developer, you want to ask questions about their data engineering skills, their knowledge of backend development tools and some of the challenges they have faced in related positions. You may also want to chip in some specific technical questions that allow you gauge their technical competency. 

## On the Day of the Interview

1.  ## Set the stage
    

When you are conducting the interview, the first thing to do is to set the candidate’s expectations on how the interview would play out. You can begin with a brief introduction of yourself, what you do for the company and what the company is about. 

It is also important to let the candidate know what to expect in the interview. For instance, you should discuss the time the interview would take and the format of the questions (whether technical, non-technical or mixed). This helps to ease the candidate’s tension and put them in the right frame of mind before you dive into the crux of the day’s business.

2.  ## Have a mix of open-ended, closed-ended and situational questions
    

Close-ended, open-ended and situational questions are the recipe for a rich interview. To be clear, close-ended questions are those that require specific answers. Perhaps, a yes or a no. Close-ended questions, on the other hand, require a more detailed answer. Open-ended questions allow you, as the interviewer, to assess the candidate’s potential whether they are explicitly saying it. Lastly, situational questions are questions that assume a business situation and determine how the candidate would approach it. Situational questions help you have a glimpse into their problem-solving skill or their mindset when faced with challenges.

Here are some other open-ended questions you can ask.

* Tell me about yourself.
    
* Describe the most challenging experience in your last job?
    
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
    
* Tell me about your last personal project?
    
* How would you describe your ideal job?
    
* Why should we hire you?
    
* How do you take feedback?
    
* How do you handle differences in a team?
    
* Why do you want to leave your current job?
    
* Tell me about an accomplishment you are proud of.
    

Here are some closed-ended questions to get basic information about the candidate.

* How long have you been at your last job?
    
* Have you worked remotely?
    
* Do you prefer to work in a small team or a large team?
    
* How many years of experience do you have in this field?
    
* Have you taken up leadership positions before?
    

Finally, you can ask some of these situational questions.

* If you assign a task to a worker and it was not done, how would you react to it?
    
* If a customer loses a tantrum while you’re on the line of duty, how would you manage the situation?
    
* What is your methodology for handling a task for the first time?
    
* How do you handle short deadlines?
    

  

3.  ## Investigate points noted in the resume
    

Remember we pointed out the need to read the resumes before the interview and highlight areas you want elucidation. This will help you confirm the integrity of their resume. If a candidate says he was a member of an NGO, you may want to ask more questions regarding his duty and experience in that capacity.

4.  ## Talk about remuneration
    

It is okay to discuss salary expectations in an interview. This is even better when you see the candidate as a good prospect. What is the point of sending in an offer letter but it gets rejected due to a low salary? To avoid this, make sure the candidate discloses their salary expectation or salary range. This helps you ascertain whether or not they fit into your budget.

5.  ## Allow the candidate to ask questions
    

As you round up, it is important to allow the candidate to ask questions. It also allows you to understand the candidate’s level of interest and how they perceive the company. The candidate could also give some constructive feedback about the interview procedure or the company’s operations.

6.  ## Write down observations
    

If you are interviewing more than one candidate, it is easy to forget the perks and let downs of each candidate. This is why it is a great idea to write down important details for each candidate. You can also use the note to rank the candidates fairly after the interview.

Some things to observe and note down include:

* Communication skills
    
* Technical knowledge
    
* Persona
    
* Body language and confidence level.
    

  

7.  ## Give a timeline on the next steps
    

Rounding up the interview, it is important to tell the candidate when they should expect feedback. Let them know when they will hear from you next and whether it is a hiring decision or another round of interviews. This helps the candidate prepare adequately for future events.

  

## Wrapping up

A great interview does not just happen, it takes preparation and practice. It is fine to rehearse interview questions and reactions in your closet before the D-day. You do not want to look unprepared or haphazard with your questions or else, it sends a wrong signal to the candidates.
