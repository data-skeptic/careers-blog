If you Google Search ‘Top tools for a Data Scientist’, chances are that you’d find SQL as one of the listed tools in many of the results. The same thing applies if you check the requirement for a Data Science job posting. But why is this the case? Why is SQL considered an important skill in your journey to become a Data Scientist? In this article, we will provide answers to these questions.

Let’s begin by briefly introducing what SQL is. 

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used for storing, retrieving and managing relational databases. SQL is widely used amongst data scientists due to its ease of use, speed and flexibility.

SQL was first introduced as an open-source querying language in 1979 although there have since been different flavors of the language. Some of the popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc. While they are all based on the same fundamental principles, there are slight variations amongst each flavor that make it suitable for specific cases.

## Why Learn SQL for Data Science?

1.  SQL is made for relational databases. 
    

Databases in many real-life applications are relational databases. A relational database is one where the data are stored in multiple tables that are connected to each other. This way, complex relationships between features can be captured. For example, imagine a company that wants to capture their deliveries for customers’ orders. They will require three databases. First, the customer data that stores the information of each customer. Second, an order database that contains the order information for every order. This database would contain the customer ID from the customer database. Third, they’d require the delivery database itself. This would contain the status of the delivery and would require the order ID from the order database. The above is a typical example of a relational database. 

In this scenario, using conventional tools such as Pandas may not be the best approach for data querying and analysis. SQL, on the other hand, is made for relational databases and gives you the flexibility to connect these databases dynamically. 

2.  SQL is great for large data
    

Data science problems always often require huge volumes of data. Thus, you require a tool that can handle huge data efficiently. Unfortunately, Excel spreadsheets or Python tools are not. SQL is one of the most efficient tools for handling big data. So if you wish to build scalable applications, SQL can be the go-to tool.

Some popular SQL-based solutions for big data include Cassandra SQL, Cloudera Impala, Spark SQL, etc. 

3.  SQL is easy to learn
    

SQL is known for its simplistic syntax. Commands are virtually written like plain English, making it easy for beginners to master in a short time. You do not have to learn low-level concepts and write long lines of code before getting insight from your data. Many basic data manipulations can be done with one line of code. This helps you master the basics of data science and allows you to hone your data querying skill in no time. 

4.  SQL is widely used in the industry
    

As a data scientist, you want to learn the skills used in the industry. This singular reason is sufficient to learn SQL as a data scientist. SQL quickly became the industry standard as far back as late 1970s when it was introduced. At the time, handling databases across different platforms was messy and SQL came as a decent solution across the board. 

According to the [Stackoverflow 2021 survey report](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021), 47.08% of professional developers use SQL today, making it the 4th most popular language. From the e-commerce sector to agriculture, to healthcare to education, SQL is used to manage their databases. Furthermore, the major database management systems allow for integration with SQL. So by learning SQL, you can utilize other DBMS and work in a broad range of fields. 

## Bottomline

While Python and R are at the fore of data science tools. SQL is a subtle, yet critical skill to have. It is without saying that it opens you up to a wider job market and makes you stand out from the crowd. Besides, SQL is an efficient way of working with complicated relational databases.
