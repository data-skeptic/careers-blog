Imagine logging into your Gmail with your correct login details, yet you get a wrong password error. Companies do not want this bad experience for their customers and that is why they employ Quality Assurance (QA) professionals. Putting it simply, a QA professional checks and tests the final product to ensure that it meets the initial product requirements and is free of bugs.

If you are looking to get into quality assurance and you are wondering what you’d be doing daily, this article discusses the day-to-day activities of a QA professional.

## 1. Develop test cases
    

Testing the product is the fundamental duty of a quality assurance professional. You will be involved in developing test cases that verify if the final product is consistent with the details in the product requirements document (PRD). 

The PRD defines the key requirement of the product in terms of purpose, functionality, behavior and feature. In cases where the final product strays away from the details of the PRD, the QA professional informs the development team to make necessary amends.

## 2. Identify bugs in the product
    

As a QA professional, you will also be checking for bugs in the product. Your goal is to test how the product will respond in all possible scenarios. You will be writing test cases to check all the product features work as they should. For instance, you may not want a user to fill in emojis as their username. It is your duty to test how the product will handle such a situation. 


QA professionals can also relay their findings to the development team on how the product should best behave in a given use case. Test cases usually involve the following:

* Functionality test case: You confirm that a feature works as intended.
    
* Security test case: You confirm there is no security breach in the product. For instance, the passwords are encrypted and secured.
    
* Performance test case: You confirm the product is fast and efficient even under high traffic.
    
* Usability test case: You ensure links are working, pages are loading, forms are receiving user inputs and so on.
    

## 3. Conduct and attend meetings
    

In most companies, a QA professional can call for a meeting with team members. They also attend daily stand-up meetings with the team, where they report what they worked on the previous day. In the meeting, they may pass information across, give progress reports, explain findings and react to questions. Meetings are also a great place to share possible challenges you are facing as a QA professional and discuss how the team can collectively help you solve them.

Also, having one-on-one meetings with the product owner, business analyst or senior engineer is not out of place.

## 4. Communicate with other team members
    

It goes without saying that a QA professional cannot work in isolation. While meetings are a great place to relate with members of the team, you will also be communicating with them outside meetings. On a daily basis, you will be sending emails clarifying requirements, responding to slack messages and sharing Google Docs documents.

You will also be relating with the product owner as well as the project manager on different grounds. You could share ideas on why the product needs modification before it is pushed to production or have your thoughts on why the customers are not interacting with a feature as envisaged.

## 5. Write test documentation and progress reports 
    

Being a QA professional does not stop at identifying faults, you must follow through to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to resolve the issue. The test documentation is used to pen down the estimated time of completing tasks assigned, the resources needed and the progress of corrective measures. In other words, the test documentation clearly states the step-by-step plan for completing a test and it is the duty of the QA professional to write and manage this documentation.

## Wrapping up

The daily routine of a QA tester is not fixed. Activities are typically hinged on varying factors such as the level of the project and the responsiveness of other team members. It is safe to say that a QA professional job is an adventure and every day comes with its own experience. If you do not like routine jobs with a fixed daily responsibility, you may consider getting into quality assurance.
