While the internet is proliferated with tons of resume templates, it remains mind-boggling to see resumes that cannot fly. Beyond having a presentable resume, the content of the resume matters much more. In this article, you will get some resume writing advice that you can apply immediately and have your resume stand out. By following the advice, you will see an appreciable increase in your job application conversion rate in next to no time. 

Let’s begin by understanding why a resume is super important in a job application process. 

## Why should you have an Attractive Resume?

A resume is your first representation when applying for a job. Without you saying a word, an employer can have a decent idea of your personality, track record, and potential. Thus, the onus is on you to ensure this ‘fictitious’ encounter with you is impressive. As they say, the first impression matters. You could literally be the best person for the job, but without a stand-out resume, you would not even get the chance to plead your case in an interview. 

The reason for a good resume is simple. It helps you get that interview call. If you do not know how to write a resume the following points will help you craft an irresistible one. 

## Best Resume Tips to Land a Job in 2022

### 1.  Having a tailor-suited resume for every job
    

The biggest mistake you can make is having a one-size-fits-all resume. A resume is meant to be peculiar to every job you are applying for. Now, I am not saying you should rewrite your resume from scratch when applying for every job. However, you should tweak your resume per time to suit the peculiarity of the job. This helps in two ways. First, if you’ve got different work experience, adding only relevant work experience will help you have a shorter and crisp resume (typically a one-pager). Second, it portrays you as the right candidate for the job. Imagine applying for a marketing job and all the work experiences you added are related to marketing. No fluff, no filler. You are quickly seen as the right fit and this is exactly what hiring managers are searching for when scanning through applications. 

### 2.  Use relevant keywords in your resume
    

As a sequel to the last point, your primary aim in any job application is to appear as the right fit for the job. And what better way of doing this than speaking the language of the job/company. Yes, you need to add relevant keywords. Read the job description and highlight keywords that come up frequently. For instance, if you are applying for a Data Science role in a fintech company, you may see keywords like time-series analysis, data visualization, storytelling, etc. Ensure to show proficiency in these fields by specifically using these words in your resume. 

Beyond showing proficiency in the field, using keywords is a technique to pass computer checks during application. Many companies use computers to initially scan resumes before it gets into the hands of a human. In fact, [a research by Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/fortune-500-use-applicant-tracking-systems/) reveals that 98.2% of the Fortune 500 companies use an applicant tracking system (ATS) in their hiring process. The ATS peruse and weed out applicants before the hiring manager even sees them. One of the ways to pass the ATS is by using the right keywords. The system is programmed to scan and identify specific keywords to determine whether you are a match or not. While the hiring managers always determine the keywords to look out for, you can have an idea of what they are by checking the job description.

A note of warning there though. You do not want to overuse keywords and sound mechanical. Many of these algorithms are trained to identify blatantly filled with keywords without passing any logical message.

### 3.  Show, don’t tell.
    

If you are applying for a job that requires hands-on skill, it is not enough to state that you have the skill, you should show that you have the skill. If you are into design, it is important to attach a link to your portfolio that shows your past projects. If it is a coding-related job, it is a no-brainer to attach your GitHub page link. Even if you think your GitHub is not pretty enough, it is advisable to attach it rather than to speak about your coding skills without proof. 

If you think you are active on LinkedIn, make sure to attach your LinkedIn profile as well. In addition, it is strongly advised to have certifications. If you do, make sure to state the certifications and the year you got it. By all means, give the hiring manager every reason not to doubt your proficiency. And the best way to do this is by showing past projects. 

### 4.  Make your proudest accomplishment conspicuous. 
    

According to [eye-tracking study](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-0117#:~:text=A%20hiring%20manager%20likes%20your,to%20this%20search%20are%20busy.), a recruiter has a resume initial screen time of 7.4 seconds. In other words, it takes only about seven seconds for a recruiter to have a positive or negative sentiment about you. To make the most of that seven seconds, you need to put your best foot forward. Your proudest accomplishments and experiences should be as visible as possible in the upper part of your resume. Chances are that it grabs their attention and gives you a better chance for a more in-depth review. 

### 5.  Content delivery should be impeccable.
    

As a job seeker, the last thing you want to have on your resume is grammatical errors, poor formatting or difficult-to-read sentences. Your content should be simple and your words punchy. Recruiters do not have the luxury of time to digest complex sentences so ensure readability is top-notch. 

In addition, try to use bullet points rather than lengthy sentences. Bullet points are generally attractive and should be lavishly used in your resume. For job activities, it is a general rule of thumb to start with action words. Finally, use numbers and metrics as much as possible. Here’s the deal. Figures do not lie. Your activities should be accompanied with proven results and measurable KPIs. Each bullet point should be in the form: did X through Y process that led to Z result. The what, why, and results should be captured in your experience description. For example, for a social media manager job, you could say, “managed the Instagram page by posting three engaging content daily which led to a 40% increase in accounts reached”. 

### 6.  Have a professional formatting
    

Speaking of content, you want to make sure your resume is well formatted. Here are some formatting tips. 

* Avoid using too many fonts. If possible, use only one professional font such as Arial, Verdana, Time News Roman, or Helvetica. 
    
* Use a font size between 10 to 12 points.  
    
* Write experience in reverse-chronological order.
    
* Write in such a way that your resume can be easily skimmed.
    
* Use bold, italic or underline to highlight important points or keywords. Make sure to not overdo it or use all three at once. 
    
* Always convert your resume to a PDF format.
    

### 7.  Proofread and edit
    

Before you send the resume out, make sure you have read it through over and over again. Eliminate phrases that are unnecessary. It is also helpful to use proofreading tools such as Grammarly to spot grammatical errors and suggest how sentences can be better constructed. You should also consider sending the resume to a friend or colleague to read through and give you feedback. Finally, leave the resume for some time and read it again with fresh eyes. You may suddenly spot better ways to improve its readability and flow. 

## Final words. 

Without a doubt, your chances of getting an interview are almost non-existent if your resume is not catchy. The reverse is the case if you do it right. In this article, you have learned some practical skills that can make your resume stand out from the crowd. So go on, apply them and watch the result that follows.
