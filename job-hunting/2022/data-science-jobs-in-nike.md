# Data Science Jobs in Nike: Why do they Need Data Scientists and how to plug in?

As of the time of writing, a search for Data Science jobs on [Nike’s career page](https://jobs.nike.com/?jobSearch=true&jsKeywords%5B0%5D=data&jsKeywords%5B1%5D=scientist&jsOffset=36&jsSort=relevance&jsLanguage=en) returns 601 jobs. That’s a really huge number for a company that produces shoes and wears. In this article, we will discuss why an apparel-producing company needs this much data science-related workforce. We’d also discuss the kind of skills required for the jobs and how they use these skills.


## Why Nike Needs Data Scientists

In June 2017, [Nike announced Customer Direct Offense](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/20/why-nike-is-laying-off-staff-and-changing-strategy.aspx), a new strategy for its brand. At its core, Customer Direct Offense was aimed at driving growth through innovation, speed, and direct interaction with customers. They halted their contracts with retail partners such as Amazon and focused on selling directly through their stores and mobile applications.

This massive decision was propelled by the need to make data-driven decisions. By directly selling to customers, Nike can have first-hand access to data for better data analytics. They can develop more predictive models for inventory management and hyper-localized demand forecasting.

Since then, the company has experienced palpable sales. The [new policy contributed $10 billion in sales in 2018](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/nike-just-do-it-with-data-science-and-demand-sensing/#_edn1). Their stock price, which was struggling, experienced a steady increase, moving from $56 in July 2017 to $114.9 in July 2021. The data-driven approach has undoubtedly been a good decision and they look to exploit it further. 

In 2018, Nike acquired Zodiac, a customer data analytics firm, and Invertex, a computer-vision company in Israel. In 2019, they acquired Boston-based data analytics and predictive company, Celect. Last year, they acquired Dialogue, a data ingestion company. These actions are all in a bid to build a robust data-centric decision-making pipeline across the board.


## The Skills Required for the Jobs



### 1. Problem-solving and analytical skills

Data science is not about fitting machine learning models but using data to solve problems. To work as a data scientist at Nike, as with many other companies, you should possess strong problem-solving skills, especially using an analytical approach. This is required for understanding the root causes of problems, modeling them, and sourcing the right data. In all of this, you will be needing good statistical knowledge to develop econometrics analysis and hypothesis testing. You would also be needing these skills in drawing final conclusions from your analysis and ultimately deciding whether the results can be trusted.



### 2. Agile product development

Agile methodologies are widely used in many companies today. As a Data Scientist at Nike, you will be working with a bunch of other professionals such as Data Engineers, Business Analysts, Data Architects, Product Owners, Software Developers, etc. Agile skills are required to achieve rapid and measurable results. Also, Agile enhances the productivity and collaboration of team members.



### 3. Data analytics with BI tools

The life cycle of a data scientist involves performing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and feature engineering. These are overlapping skills of a Data Analyst. However, a Data Scientist needs to be capable of using Business Intelligence tools for Data Analytics. BI tools are great for data cleaning and ingestion which is 70% of a data scientist’s job. They are also great for data visualization, dashboarding, and storytelling. 



### 4. Communication skills

Communication skills are required in many data science roles. Not only are you to discover insights from data, but you are also required to adequately communicate your findings with stakeholders. As a data scientist, you will be involved in team meetings, elicitation processes, presentations, and loads of collaboration. You may also be required to write official reports and build convincing dashboards. These responsibilities will need strong communication skills.


## Tools used in Most Data Science Jobs



### 1. Python

Python is widely used in the data science domain for a myriad of purposes. Whether it is for data munging, visualization, analysis, or building machine learning models, Python has a library for it. You may be required to use Pandas and Numpy to clean and wrangle data, or statsmodel, a Python library, for econometric and statistical analysis. There are several data visualization tools in Python at your disposal. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, GGplot, Altair, you name it.

Also, Tensorflow, Keras, and Pytorch are widely used to build machine-learning models in Python.



### 2. Pyspark

Pyspark is the Python library that enables you to use Spark with Python. A huge company such as Nike generates data in high volume, veracity, and velocity. Using traditional data analytics tools may not be practicable for developing scalable models. In order to tackle large scale problems, while seamlessly coordinating with the engineering teams, a good knowledge of Pyspark is critical.



3. SQL

SQL is at the foundation of many data-driven pipelines. It is widely used in building and managing databases. As a data scientist, good knowledge of SQL is needed for querying the right data for your analysis. SQL is also great for working with relational databases — something that many Python tools are incapable of. If you want to learn more about why data scientists need SQL, you can [read this article](http://careers.dataskeptic.com/blog/learning/2022/the-importance-of-learning-sql-for-a-data-scientist-1663602673703). 



### 4. Airflow

Apache Airflow is a powerful tool used for scheduling, automating, and managing multiple data workflows and pipelines. Airflow allows you to produce reproducible codes and repeat complex processes, whilst producing the same result. In addition, Airflow is useful for better collaboration among team members. You can wrap individual tasks in the form of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), and be sure of consistent output irrespective of the machine running it, who is running it, or the number of runs. Away from that, Airflow can also be used to connect data science workflows to multiple data sources.



### 5. Tableau or Power BI

As mentioned earlier, BI tools are widely used in data science roles. Learning either Tableau or Power BI is sufficient, as they are the most popular and they have overlapping capabilities. With these tools, you can quickly ingest raw data, clean them and perform data analysis procedures. In addition, BI tools are used for understanding the data through visualizations before building machine learning models.



### 6. AWS, GCP, or Azure

Cloud is without a doubt, a trend that has come to stay in the tech space. Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Azure, and Microsoft Azure all have tools for building scalable machine learning models on the cloud. There are also AutoML tools that let you build machine learning models with a few clicks. Cloud computing platforms are a great way to access high compute without breaking the bank. Some common tools include Amazon’s EC2, AWS Databricks, AWS SageMaker, GCP Datalab, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, Google’s Cloud ML, BigQuery, and so on.


## Wrapping up

In this article, we discussed why Nike, a show-producing company, needs a lot of data scientists. This is a pointer to the fact that Data Science can be applied in virtually all industries across various strata. By learning the tools discussed here and mastering the fundamental skills, you are well on your way to landing data science roles in Nike or other data-driven firms.
