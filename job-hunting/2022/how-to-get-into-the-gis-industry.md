# How to Get Into the GIS Industry

Geographic information systems (GIS) is one of the lucrative yet unsung careers in tech. Now more than ever, the opportunities in the field are on the increase. According to [<ins>P&S Intelligence</ins>](https://www.psmarketresearch.com/press-release/global-geographic-information-system-market), the GIS market is projected to experience an annual growth of 11.6% between 2020 and 2030, reaching a market valuation of $24.6 billion. Are you a beginner, looking to begin a career in GIS? Are you unsure of where to get started? In this article, you will discover a roadmap to begin a career in GIS.

Let’s begin with an introduction to GIS and why it is a good career path in 2022.

## What is GIS?

GIS is a computer system that captures the spatial information of the earth's landscape, structure, and topography in an abstract form for further analysis. While maps are the crux of GIS, GIS goes beyond maps. It features other geographic information and tools that enable more complex spatial analysis. For instance, the knowledge of GIS can help urban planners not only analyze physical spaces but understand cultural, social and economic problems across different locations.

## Opportunities that Exist After Learning GIS

GIS is a broad field with numerous opportunities. You can decide to become a climate scientist where you observe patterns in the weather. This is critical in tackling the problem of global warming and other climate challenges. 

GIS can also be used in the health sector for tracking and analyzing diseases based on location. Based on past spatial data records, a health geographer can predict specific regions that are susceptible to a given ailment and recommend proactive measures. to forestall its spread. 

If you are a lover of nature, you can become a conservationist after learning GIS. With GIS, you can collect data on different landscapes and identify prospective natural parks for preservation.

Also, you can work as an urban planner. Urban societies are typically faced with several issues ranging from traffic congestion to construction problems, crimes, and so on. As a GIS specialist, you can analyze the spatial information of urban areas, observe trends and patterns and recommend plans for smooth societal activities. 

In agriculture, GIS can be used to determine the kind of crops that fits a given land. By analyzing the land texture and nutrients, GIS specialists can help farmers identify the best way to maximize their yield.

Besides, you can decide to work in law enforcement agencies to identify crimes by analyzing previous crime patterns in the city.

In addition to the above, you can decide to become a GIS developer where you build GIS tools and software for others. ArcGIS, a popular GIS software, was first released in 1999. Since then, they have created other power products such as ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Map, ArcGIS Enterprise, etc. All these were created and modified by GIS developers.

## Technical Requirements of a GIS Specialist

As a GIS Specialist, it is generally recommended to have proficiency in the following tools:

1.  **An Esri-based software preferable ArcGIS**: ArcGIS is the major tool in the GIS space. It can be used for analyzing spatial data to extract information. Before stepping into an interview on your ArcGIS skill, here are some skills you must have mastered on the software. First, you must have learned how to work with the basic ArcMap tools and work with shapefiles. Also, you should know how to create maps and layouts on the software, as well as add spatial data to maps. It is also recommended to know how to work with data tables as it helps you display and analyze raw data.
    
2.  **Google Earth Engine**: Depending on the kind of job, working knowledge of Google Earth Engine may be required. Google Earth Engine is typically used for observing changes around the earth’s surface. It uses an enormous amount of satellite imagery data to identify updated changes and the earth and make map trends. You can also use algorithms to analyze maps, terrains, and buildings for various use cases. The Google Earth Engine code editor uses JavaScript as its programming language. So it is important to learn JavaScript to use Google Earth Engine efficiently.
    
3.  **AutoCAD**: AutoCAD is a popular CAD software for designing 2D and 3D structures, road networks, electrical diagrams, etc. However, it can be synced with GIS tools for better communication between architects, urban planners, surveys, and GIS specialists. In fact, there is now an ArcGIS for AutoCAD plug-in that gives users the ability to work with and share GIS data with AutoCAD. 
    
4.  **Spatial database management tool**: Since a GIS specialist analyses spatial data, the data itself needs to be stored and managed. Tools such as ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap can be used for storing geodatabase — the native data format for ArcGIS. You can also use PostGIS, an open-source extension of PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Amazon Aurora, Oracle, etc.
    
5.  **Python for scripting and model building**: On ArcMap ModelBuilder, you can write Python scripts for creating customized models. GIS models perform various computations of one or more processes to return an output. Simply put, they are used for automating GIS tasks. Many companies love to use Python for model building in GIS, as it is easy to learn and also integrated with the major GIS softwares.
    

## How to get into GIS?

### 1.  Commit to learning
    

Of course, the first step to getting into GIS is to learn about GIS. You can decide to get a bachelor's, master's or online degree in GIS. Most degrees will take courses in geography and planning, geographic information science, map science, remote sensing, etc.

You could also decide to take online courses on GIS or watch YouTube tutorials. Whichever route you take, you will need to commit to learning for some time. GIS can be quite intimidating at first, but with time, you begin to get the hang of it.

### 2.  Work with projects
    

The best way to learn is by doing. While it is great to listen to lectures, you will get better by learning to use GIS software firsthand. ArcGIS is one popular GIS software you can practice with. You can subscribe to ArcUser for free, and use the ArcGIS Resource to learn how to use the various tools. You can make maps online with ArcGIS Online both on your PC or tablet in a few minutes and share them with colleagues for review. Having such hands-on experience will give you a lasting experience on how to use the ArcGIS software and get proficient at it.

### 3.  Get a certification
    

Certifications are an official way of proving your proficiency level in a given field. You can stand out in this field by getting a recognized GIS certification. Some include the GISP certification, the Esri Technical certification, and online certifications from universities. It is important to note that many of these certifications require you to pass a standard exam. Thus, you are only encouraged to go for certification after you are confident with your skills. There are a couple of free GIS training and certification training online as well. You may consider checking Coursera, Alison, or EDX course catalogs for free GIS certification training.

### 4.  Connect with GIS professionals online
    

I cannot overstate the place of building meaningful connections. As you progress with your learning, connect with professionals online. LinkedIn is a great place to meet with GIS professionals. Beyond your connection, actively engage others' posts. But most importantly, share your new learnings as well. If you recently learned about shape files or raster files, share them with your connections. Not only does this put you out there, but it is also a potent way to demonstrate your dexterity for further opportunities.

### 5.  Find volunteering or internship opportunities
    

This ties back to the last point. As you build your online footprint, be open to volunteering in NGOs and other pro-bono activities. This gives you work experience that would become relevant when applying for a job. Also, keep your eyes peeled for internship opportunities. Apart from the technical experience internships give you, you get to build connections that may be the springboard to full-time job offers.

###  Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed how you can get into the GIS industry. As earlier mentioned, this is an industry with very little online hype, yet has a wide range of applications in the job market. If you have a knack for maps and spatial data, hopefully, this article has broken down how you can break into the GIS space. Start today!
