# AI in Content Creation

In the 21st century, content is king. But if you have ever written a social media post, a meeting report, or a blog post, you’d agree that creating content can be a hassle. Like in other fields, artificial intelligence has tremendously grown in the content creation space over the past few years. Today, writing content can be less stressful given the many AI tools at our disposal.

This article will discuss how artificial intelligence has influenced content writing. You’d discover how you can leverage AI tools as a writer, the plug-and-play AI tools you can get started with, and what the future looks like for creatives. We’d also test with these tools to see the content they generate for a given topic.

## How does AI help writers?

Here’s how AI can eliminate writer’s block syndrome. First, writers can leverage AI for preliminary research. Imagine getting all the relevant resources you need without combing multiple websites to sift the relevant content. With the advancement of NLP models, content writers can get tailor-suited answers to random questions.

Beyond that, AI also does SEO content. The machine learning models do not just churn out content, but take keywords into consideration and place them strategically. 

Lastly, AI tools can help scale your content creation game. If you want to write thousands of articles in a short time, you can use some of the AI tools discussed in this article while you sleep.

## OpenAI’s GPT-3

On 11th July 2020, OpenAI announced the release of GPT-3. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a powerful AI model used to perform natural language processing tasks. To train the model, the AI tool crawled billions of pages of text online, to the tune of over 45TB in size. There were 175 billion training parameters, giving the model a high level of complexity. GPT-3 can generate landing pages, write blog posts, answer open-ended questions, summarize text, translate language, compose a song and so on.  GPT-3 also boasts of converting natural language to code in different programming languages. 

Using the GPT-3 API for writing requires only simple commands of your intention. You input some texts as a prompt and the model completes the text based on the learned context. As found in their documentation, if you give the API the prompt, “write a tagline for an ice cream shop”, for instance, GPT-3 can return “we serve up smiles with every scoop”. How ingenious!

Although GPT-3 is not publicly available for free, developers can make use of their APIs to access the power of the GPT-3 engine. Today, numerous AI tools harness the GPT-3 engine for specific NLP use cases, some of which will be discussed in this article. 

If you are looking to personally use GPT-3, however, there is an open source version, called GPT-Neo, that mirrors the potential of GPT-3. Note that it is not as powerful as the paid version of GPT-3 Davinci (GPT-3’s most advanced version).

If the whole idea of GPT-3 looks intangible, let’s see practical AI tools widely used for content writing today. 

## AI tools for content creation

## 1.  CopyAI
    

CopyAI is a GPT-3 powered AI tool designed to generate professional documents for startup teams, marketing agencies, and copywriters. It can write captivating headlines, email subject titles, article intros, ad stories, and so on. Writing a copy requires critical thinking, psychology, and strategizing. CopyAI does all that in one sweep. 

CopyAI was designed to generate sales copy, blog posts, digital ad copy, social media content, and so on.

Now, let’s put CopyAI to the test. In this example, I ask the system to generate a blog outline. The blog title was set to: Is data science truly the sexiest career path of this century? The tone was set to be professional, with data science as the only keyword.

The screenshot below reveals the result.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b8dOD6z1qLISQAZj7S9lBU13JL2m-lJ6GmbQoCH9JflGwqb3Mk_Ns-fggd3wyZrk8DvDWiP9wNsqOr_dGU7LeyAuJC6tcwXkkTtHqGYMNDG0edKikCEtPTi2BS8qCyDXHKcW4844t76700NYvn90hg2G84svAgL_6Gdyk_Wn69O9-YCmPm06jDFrJg)

Now, let’s generate the talking points for all the subheadings.

Finally, let’s generate the content.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JNVpSDrExtB3Ndi-I0djrW5PKMsIJ0lrqGNRMwftd4QuCU3Y5oGhco1xJY9c5cXAJ8zS0U8C1UiX2fYEsNVdKP945PwegB9W_pFcYCZnPB2x2m3mYuwbFfS4pJOxhdzTIM9Gva1L0JS93sRt2_w2obVs230gRomoTachGF89CPXapmDaNt2f92QjtA)

### What do I think of CopyAI content?

First, it is important to note that the blog title was an opinion. This was in a bid to see if the AI model can take a stand on issues. The content looks great in terms of readability. However, the content seems to focus on data science and does not directly posit whether it was a great career path. Nevertheless, the conclusion passed a strong message about data scientists being in high demand, which could translate to it being a good career path. Overall, the article was impressive in my opinion.

It is important to state that all stages of the content took less than 10 seconds to generate.

### Pros of CopyAI

* Has a 7-day free trial

* Can write in multiple languages

* There are over 90+ content templates to choose from

### Cons of CopyAI

* There are no third-party integrations.

## 2.  Writesonic
    

Writesonic is an AI assistant tool for different writing purposes. It can be used for writing sales emails, posts up to 1500 words, product descriptions for eCommerce stores, social media content, etc. You can also rephrase existing content, rewrite articles, get ideas for new articles, write outlines, etc. 

Writesonic generates relevant content from declared keywords or titles in less than 15 seconds. The tool has integration possibilities with Wix, WordPress, Shopify, etc, allowing you to publish the generated content in one click. 

Now, let’s put Writesonic to test using the same topic: Is data science truly the sexiest career path of this century? We’d begin by generating the introduction as shown below.

  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IyYj73VyzX2UCunI3ZXOtrCj-q7PE8D34TpyaueJJrfqKMWEtmrft539TdbwFs3mR1mnjyFQRyR_XY-sGay7XVM29IKbTWeOr5LfNjBuWyhAcS95d4sPwS3S3qYbE1K0S4H7DlFpsUkL9l5DyX6QqDTZS-JGj48ZTdw3nFZvSK50uakvAteHBcXCMg)

Next, we generate the outline shown below.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lrPUZh1yu6kJPGrrRlspRpod7rakqRZ85zR8sqWSOsnrMZi4yhrOR9FLtp2MG01E3JgOslV7UCJOt15imenexUylzcZ_xhTNe2bMpxBcYQgH9Vkw_mQuBncdumuXg8TqZmefcLJp-pP7PQIJwJa3p150x_OgjJcRvYmssGSbGiNYiOMlPMrRisrLVw)

  

Using the first introduction and outline in the screenshot, the entire article can now be generated.

### What do I think about Writesonic Content?

I think the content is really nice. The introduction portrayed data science as a field with many job opportunities. The core of the article focused on the different hats a Data Science can wear. This reiterates the fact that the skills of Data Science are in high demand. Overall, I think Writesonic did justice to the topic. It extensively spoke about the opportunities that abound in Data Science and how to get into them.

  

### Pros of Writesonic

* Can work with over 25 languages

* Has a flexible subscription plan (pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription).

* Can be used for different purposes

### Cons of Writesonic

* There are no tutorials that fully explain all the features

* The free trial gives access to limited features.
  
  

## 3.  Rytr
    

Rytr is another GPT-3 powered content generation tool. It can be used to write blog articles, YouTube scripts, landing pages, emails, social media content, and so on. Rytr is generally regarded as a cheaper alternative to other AI writing tools such as CopyAI. 

If you are not looking for an overly complicated article, in the shortest possible time, Rytr is a great option. Rytr only requires the keywords, the use case of the content, and your desired tone. It then churns out different variants of unique content within seconds.

Now let’s see an example of Rytr’s content. Again, the same topic: Is data science truly the sexiest career path of this century? 

Here is the initial outline from Rytr.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NHyV0z6xKRWi3bYnfJ9WKZaUq08sWkB6YMsFk4p0u-1BlrNZSVC5pgyySG3CMM_hqi29kvec5JgqkACm3Skxya-8NT1IX-LxLjWynM2TLRZsuiHh1XW3LXbaZA1KLhb3b_QZDs9Qox5VbC5pdo3yn7rCInUEK4LUqq_lXW3RqFrGkVkDkr58s_d0zw)

After generating more content for each subheading, this was the result

### What do I think about Rytr’s Content?

It is apparent that Rytr is not the best option for long-form and complicated content. It is however great to generate ideas or short content.

### Pros of Rytr

* Can work with 29 languages

* It has useful editing features such as rephrasing, shortening, explaining, checking for plagiarism, etc.

* It is a cheaper alternative

* It can be used for multiple use cases

### Cons of Rytr

## 4. Scalenut
    

Scalenut uses AI to write SEO content from scratch. It only requires the keyword you wish to rank for, after which it generates possible titles, ideas for the subheadings, short notes for each subheading, and finally the entire draft article. 

Now, let’s see an example of Scalenut content. The screenshot below shows its introduction.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/arTvcCXYpOtTF4IQOJOFmqOE0wvzAVVVfeCWKeaC8XTf7sLArPisJSC5XUfbtKzlyEsrh9SDTTc6FoIhu9PyZ1dXOZ8HqHuCrpcaUUKfA5s2Rf6At_Lk_VprniVCmCPIL1A4fGAVswJEDKuhwCzz12SHs4-vIx5cmQFcDVrSuCIYT-ZsQhVD77AQlQ)

The final draft is shown below

### What do I think about Scalenut’s Content?

The content looks good. However, the subheadings seem to be all over the place. This may not be a problem as one can always regenerate the content. Ignoring the broad subheadings, the content flow was good and Scalenut seemed to hit the nail on the head. 

### Pros of Scalenut

* It is great for keyword targeting and SEO
    
* It is easy to use
    

### Con of Scalenut

* There is no direct integration with WordPress
    


Two other worthy mentions that could not be tested are:

## 5.  Frase
    

Frase is an AI-powered tool for content creation. The tool has two products: Frase Content Generator and Frase Answers. Frase Content  Generator works by scouting for related content around your proposed title and writing new content with high quality. It takes it a step further by identifying relevant questions, and by extension keywords for SEO. Thus, the content generated on Frase is SEO optimized which can assist you in outranking your competitors. For instance, imagine you sell dresses but didn’t know that a large chunk of your customers search for dresses in red. Frase can identify a keyword such as ‘red dinner gowns’ and incorporate them in your content.

Fraise Answers is an AI chatbot that answers questions of your buyer on your website. It scraps your web pages, blogs, FAQs, etc, and trains itself to generate tailor-suited answers to questions about your product. This potentially increases the conversion rate of your product, while placing less mechanical effort on you. As an example, a customer may ask whether you ship to a particular location. While most chatbots give general answers, Fraise can generate a more personalized information for the customer, based on how the question was phrased.

### Pros of Frase

It saves you valuable time for content research and SEO.

As of the time of writing this article, its pricing starts at $39.99 which is a cheaper alternative

It generates content quickly

It is easy to use

### Con of Frase

There is no free trial. However, there is a 5-day 100% refund policy.

## 6.  AI Writer
    

AI Writer is another tool powered by artificial intelligence for content generation. It uses state-of-the-art NLP models to write articles from keywords or headlines alone. The tool works by scrapping relevant articles online, based on the given title, and rewriting them to beat plagiarism. It can also list references to verify the accuracy of the information generated. 

AI Writer can also reword existing content and come up with new subtopics. It finds related questions and provides content that answers them. Thus, making your content SEO friendly, readable and driving more traffic.

### Pros of AI Writer

Can generate an entire article within two minutes

Lists citations and references

Has a one-week free trial

### Cons of AI Writer

It supports English only

There are no templates for writing

## The Big Picture

From all that has been said, the question is, what can’t AI do? With the arrival of GPT-3, the capabilities of AI in content writing seem never-ending. Some people believe AI will eventually take the place of writers. 

While the advancement of AI is unquestionable, there are a few things that it cannot. For instance, to date, no AI system has successfully passed the Turing test. In the context of content writing, it means humans can still notice something off about content written by AI. In addition, it is believed that an AI system cannot write something new. It only rewrites existing content. Putting it simply, AI cannot match the creativity and ingenuity of human writers.

Gary Marcus, a Professor of Psychology at NYU has always reiterated his skepticism of AI replacing humans. In 2018, he [<ins>published a paper</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631) that highlights then concerns about AI tools. In an [<ins>article published in New Yorker</ins>](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence), Gary compared deep learning models to traditional models as a ‘better ladder’. In his words, “Hinton has built a better ladder; but a better ladder doesn’t necessarily get you to the moon”.

## Conclusion

This article has discussed the achievement of AI in content creation. We spoke about the powerful GPT-3 model and other AI tools used for content creation today. Given the foregoing, the notion that AI can potentially replace human writers is becoming more concrete. Although such thoughts are understandable, their actualization is still far-reaching.
