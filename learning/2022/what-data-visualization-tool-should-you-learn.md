# What Data Visualization Tool should you learn?

Data visualization is a critical component of any data science undertaking. It gives you, the data scientist, the ability to cut through the noise and understand the data easily. You get to quickly find trends, outliers and hidden patterns, and consequently, communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders. In your quest to learn data visualization, however, you will be greeted with several tools. 

If you are an aspiring data scientist, and you are unsure about the particular tool to learn, this article will discuss 5 popular data visualization tools in the market today. We’d discuss their features, benefits and some drawbacks. Let’s jump into it.

## Matplotlib
    

Matplotlib is a popular Python library for data visualization. It creates 2D plots using low-level codes. Matplotlib was built on top of Numpy and can create a wide range of plots such as bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, line charts, etc. You can also define color palettes, themes, colormaps, etc. One major benefit of matplotlib is that it is cross-platform and can work with numerous operating systems and graphics backend. It is widely used in Jupyter Notebook, alongside other tools such as [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

Matplotlib plotting styles may however come off as old-fashioned, especially if you are not so fluid with tweaking the plot’s parameters. Further to that, you would require a decent understanding of Python to create plots on Matplotlib. Because the library is low-level, you will also be required to explicitly define every detail of your plot, even down to the plot title, keys, and x and y-axis labels. On the flip side, that could be an advantage if you are vast with the tool — it gives you a lot of control.

### Strengths

* It is a powerful and cross-platform tool.
    
* It is widely used in the industry.
    
* It provides a lot of flexibility and control.
    

### Drawbacks

* Plots may look old-fashioned if you are not so used to the tool.
    
* It requires a decent understanding of Python.
    

## D3
    

D3 (which stands for data-driven documents) is a JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate documents based on data. In other words, you can automatically render web pages containing HTML or SVG elements. D3 is widely used today for creating interactive data visualizations on web pages. You may have guessed that D3 requires a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

While learning D3 may be daunting at first, it allows you to work with the internals of webpages and DOM (Document Object Models) elements. The possibilities of D3 are limitless. D3 is widely used by web developers to create appealing visualizations on web pages. Learning D3 would no doubt be an extra addition to your portfolio if you are applying for web development roles.

You can begin with D3 using simple examples [here](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/intro_d3js.html). Find other D3 plots with code [here](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/) .

### Strengths

* Can create beautiful and dynamic visualizations on web pages.
    
* You can build upon someone’s work
    
* It is a hirable skill
    
* It gives you an incredible amount of granularity
    
* Has a huge online community
    

### Drawback

* It has a steep learning curve
    
* Requires a strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    

## Ggplot
    

Ggplot is a powerful data visualization tool in the R programming language. It creates plots based on special structures called the grammar of graphics. There are three basic graphics elements ggplot uses. They are the data, aesthetics and geometry. The data is simply the dataset to be used. The aesthetics, on the other hand, differentiates what variables would be mapped to the x-axis, y-axis, point color, etc. Finally, the structure is the type of plot you wish to draw. They could be a scatter plot, barplot, boxplot, line plot, histogram, etc.

Other structures in Ggplot grammar of graphics include statistics, labels, coordinate space, etc. If you are looking to learn Ggplot, you would first be faced with new terminologies you have to get used to. It is also advisable to learn the basics of R before delving into Ggplot. The tool is however not so difficult to learn and is super popular in the R community.

### Strengths

* It is easy to use
    
* It can create powerful plots with a lot of flexibility
    

### Drawback

* It involves coding in R which is declining in popularity compared to Python.
    

## EChart
    

EChart is a powerful JavaScript library by Apache. Unlike D3, ECharts has many data visualization templates that can get you up and running quickly. You can create complex and interactive visualization that suits your exact needs by simply editing the hundreds of templates It has gained wide popularity amongst front-end developers for creating visually appealing charts on webpages.

EChart is a declarative framework, meaning you only have to define what you wish to accomplish without getting involved with the inner process. This again is unlike D3, which is mostly low-level.

Because EChart is open-source, there are available libraries that allow you to access the possibilities of ECharts in different languages. [Pyecharts](https://pyecharts.org/#/), for instance, is a Python library that allows Python developers to create EChart plots in Python.

### Strengths

* It is relatively easier to learn
    
* It can create powerful and interactive visualizations that are web-friendly
    
* It has a rapidly growing community
    
* It has loads of templates to get you started
    

### Drawback

* You may require some knowledge of JavaScript to work with the templates
  

## Tableau
    

Tableau is an easy-to-use data visualization tool for business analysis. It can ingest the data and create powerful and interactive plots for data analysis. Beyond that, it is great for data reporting with its dashboarding features.

Tableau has different products in its suites. Tableau Desktop is one of the products and perhaps, the most popular. It is the software you install on your PC and is great for individuals with zero-coding experience. The software uses drag and drop gestures.

Others Tableau Products include Tableau Server, Tableau Public, Tableau Reader, etc. With Tableau Server, you can collaborate with specific people in an organization after publishing your worksheets in Tableau Desktop. Tableau Public lets you save your workbook on the cloud rather than on your personal computer. This is great if you want your work to be easily assessed by the general public. 

Tableau can pull data from different sources such as a spreadsheet, pdf or a relational database in real-time. It is integrated with many applications for a more fluid workflow.

### Strengths

* It has real-time data sourcing and blending
    
* It has powerful data analysis and reporting features
    
* Great for collaborating with other team members
    

### Drawbacks

* Tableau is free but has payment plans for different licenses
    
* There are troubleshooting limitations
    


## Final words

You have seen how five powerful data visualization tools are used in the industry. If you are an aspiring data scientist with knowledge of Python, matplotlib is a great library to learn. You may eventually learn Seaborn or Plotly. If you are adventurous, have a decent knowledge of JavaScript and want to learn how to create powerful web visualization from data, D3 may be for you. If however, you do not want to go too in-depth, yet have some knowledge of JavaScript, give EChart a shot. ggplot is fantastic for R programmers while Tableau is great when you do not want to write codes, but still want to create appealing charts for analysis.
