If you want to master Tableau as quickly as possible, there are a couple of ways you can do it. In this article, we will discuss two platforms to get high-quality Tableau crash courses in a matter of clicks. You can practically get comfortable with Tableau by investing just one hour of your time into learning. 

## 1. Coursera
    

Coursera is a one-stop shop for online courses. The platform was founded in 2012 by a Professor of Computer Science and a renowned educator of Machine Learning, Andrew Ng. The platform particularly gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic when online learning gained traction. Coursera has a plethora of courses in different fields including Data Visualization with Tableau. 

One unique perk of Coursera is that many of its courses are organized by accomplished lecturers in top universities. Thus, you can expect to get standard courses. Coursera certificates are also widely respected, given that courses are mostly overseen by university faculties. Here are some of the Tableau courses you can find on Coursera.

* [Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-tableau): This course is offered by the University of California. The course has recorded over 155,000 enrolled students and has garnered a 4.5 rating on average. The course is intended for an absolute beginner, so you do not need any background knowledge to follow along. You are expected to complete the course after spending approximately nine hours. So if you put in 2 hours daily, you’d be home and dry in less than a week. It’s a great course to get familiar with the workings of Tableau. 
    
* [Visualizing CitiBike Trips with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/projects/visualizing-citibike-trips-tableau): If you’d like to get your hands dirty right off the bat, then you should consider this course. This is a project-based training offered by Coursera Project Network. It is a one-hour course that uses the CitiBike Trips dataset as a use case to practice data visualization with Tableau. The entire process is explained step-by-step, so even as a complete beginner, you can learn by doing. I cannot overstate the immediate reward that this kind of course brings. It does not only give you a tangible Tableau project under your belt within an hour, it also boosts your confidence to handle other projects. So check this out if you like to learn with hands-on projects.
    
* [Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-tableau#about): This is another great course on Cousera offered by Duke University. The lead instructor is Daniel Egger, an Executive in the Center for Quantitative Modeling at Pratt School of Engineering. This one is a little bit bulkier as it requires at least 25 hours to complete. Ideally, you are meant to finish the course in 5 weeks. But if you speed things up (dedicate 2 hours a day), you can finish in less than 2 weeks. The course ends with a final project where you get to develop a data-driven business process change proposal. You will be required to make your presentation using charts in Tableau. Thus, giving you a strong command of the tool. 
    

Note: Some courses on Coursera are not free. However, you can apply for financial aid with tangible reasons stating why you want the course fee waived. Most genuine financial aid applications get granted so do not shy away from applying if you need it.

## 2. YouTube 
    

YouTube is the second most visited website in the world after Google. The platform has undoubtedly become all-encompassing with regards to anything video. You can be sure to find top-notch Tableau courses on YouTube. And of course, for free. 

Here are some of the YouTube Tableau tutorials you can find on YouTube. 

* [Tableau for Data Science and Data Visualization - Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPMlZxRRaBQ): This is arguably one of the shortest Tableau courses you’d find online. The course lasts for only 28 minutes. In that short time, however, you will learn how to create incredible visualization using Tableau. The course makes use of the Titanic dataset as a case study and teaches you how to draw insight from data using Tableau’s drag and drop features. The course was put together by  Charlotte Data Scientist but was uploaded on the freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel. It’s a good place to start if you need something really short. 
    
* [Tableau Full Course - Learn Tableau in 6 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHaOIvR00So): ThisTableau course is organized by Edureka, a top edutech company in India. In 6 hours, it explains Tableau from scratch, why you need Tableau, getting used to the Tableau UI, functions in Tableau, data types in Tableau, the several charts in Tableau, munging data in Tableau and so much more.  The latter part of the course was dedicated to interview questions and answers. It is indeed a rounded course, in yet a relatively short time. So if you’d like to understand the nitty-gritty of Tableau, without reading cumbersome textbooks, you should consider checking this course. 
    
* [Tableau Expert Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlBIhpDjhbY): This course was organized by Simplilearn. Simplilearn is known for its beautiful explanations and this Tableau course is no different. It has a fine blend of theoretical explanation and practical sessions with Tableau. Again, if you wish to learn the theory, before delving into hands-on projects, you should consider this course. It explains Data Visualization from the very beginning, allowing complete neophytes to grasp the explanations. It is quite a longer course as it is over 8 hours. If you do not mind the longer time, it is worth it for the value of knowledge you’d gain. 
    

## Tying it all up

There you have it. You have discovered six unique Tableau courses you can take when you urgently want to learn the tool. Cousera and YouTube are quite different in terms of student-instructor bonding but in the end, they both are great platforms to learn Tableau really quickly. Meanwhile, this is not an exhaustive list. There are other Tableau courses you can explore on both platforms. So go ahead, get in and have fun learning.
