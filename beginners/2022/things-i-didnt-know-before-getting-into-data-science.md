Some years ago, I was a complete neophyte trying to transition into data science. Before deciding to learn data science, there were some preconceived notions I had about the field. After getting my hands dirty, however, it was a different ball game and a rude shock to realize some of my premonitions were not entirely true. In this article, I will share some of the things I didn’t know before getting into data science. If you are a beginner wanting to start a data science career, this article will put you on the right track to what data science really is. Let’s get in.

## 1. Data science can be applied everywhere
    

I have always thought that data science was a narrow field meant particularly for only fintech startups and FAANG. As someone with a Mechanical Engineering background, I believed that my Mechanical Engineering knowledge would not be needed anymore. But it was not long before I found that to be untrue. Not too long after I was comfortable with my data science skills, I volunteered in an open-source project where other data scientists and I attempted to build a machine learning model that predicted areas with low-power supply across the country. Guess what! My knowledge in Mechanical Engineering was super relevant in finding the most efficient energy source, developing better energy source alternatives, and wrangling the data appropriately. 

It quickly dawned on me that your strong knowledge of a specific niche is still relevant as a Data Scientist. In fact, domain knowledge is one of the three major ingredients of data science.

So if you are a pharmacist, you can be a data scientist trying to analyze data for the best performing drug in the pharmaceutical industry. Even for fields that are not STEM-designated, you can find data science roles that equally require a background in your domain. Data science is simply ubiquitous.

## 2. Data science requires programming
    

I used to think programming was an optional requirement in data science. But I soon discovered that it is what differentiates data science from data analysis. Coding is, in fact, another ingredient of data science.

As a Data Scientist, programming helps you write tailor-suited algorithms to wrangle data, distill relevant insights and build machine learning models.

Having discovered this, I thought programming in data science required learning either Python or R alone. While those are the most popular programming languages for data science, SQL is equally fundamental. Many job descriptions in data science require a working knowledge of SQL. If you wish to know more about why every data scientist should learn SQL, you can read this article we wrote about it.

## 3. How to tell the difference between data science and machine learning.
    

It is difficult to differentiate between data science and machine learning. They became buzzwords that could be used interchangeably and it took some time to understand their differences. Data science involves the process of generating insight from data using various statistical methods. Machine Learning, on the other hand, focuses on building models that can perform tasks it was not programmed to do.

So what is the relationship? Machine learning involves data, and by extension, a data scientist expertise. The process of developing a machine learning model involves training the system on historical data to find hidden patterns. It is said that data preprocessing takes more than 70% of the time when building a machine learning model. If machine learning is the end, data science is largely the means to that end.

## 4. Data science is an iterative process
    

I believed that after building machine learning with an accuracy of above 90%, I was home and dry. But, yet again, I was wrong. As a data scientist, it is important to constantly inspect the model’s performance, add more training data and retrain the model if possible. You may also need to tweak the hyperparameters to achieve better results when training on the new data.

Imagine a business that builds a predictive model with data before the COVID-19 pandemic. The model could learn that their customers prefer buying their goods in physical stores. But the unprecedented sit-at-home policy of the pandemic might have changed that. Not retraining the model after the pandemic would result in an inaccurate model, and thus, a declining revenue.

## 5. Data engineering is as important as data science.
    

Data science has always been at the fore, ‘undermining’ the importance of its counterpart, data engineering. As a data science learner, it is easy to get data from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning repository or Google Public Dataset. But I never thought about how this data was retrieved, managed and stored. Now, however, I recognise the important roles data engineers play. Data engineers build and manage data infrastructures that allow data scientists to operate. They are the backbone of data scientists. Without data engineers, there can be no data. Without data, data science and machine learning are impossible.

## Wrapping up

In closing, this article has hopefully beamed light on some confusing thoughts about data science. Even with all the hype around data science, there is more to it than meets the eyes. Now you know better.
