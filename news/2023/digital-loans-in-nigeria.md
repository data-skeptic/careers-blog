# Digital Loans in Nigeria

Access to digital loans has grown tremendously in the past couple of years in Nigeria. Reports show that the transaction value of consumer lending in Nigeria’s marketplace is set to experience a [CAGR of 5.3% between 2023 to 2027](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-capital-raising/marketplace-lending-consumer/nigeria), hitting a total amount of $82.4 million by 2027. With a smartphone and internet connection, a loan in Nigeria can be assessed within a couple of minutes. This is with zero collateral, no guarantor signage, and no prolonged formal documentation. Some 10 years ago, this was far from possible. In this article, we will take a look into how the Nigerian market became proliferated with digital lenders. You would discover how these loan companies operate and the impact it has had on the people.


## Some Background about Nigeria's Credit System

Nigeria, like many other developing countries, has a credit system still in its infancy. Before now, loans were typically obtained by traditional banks. As expected, they would require collateral, heavy background checks, and a series of documentation before the applicants stand a chance for approval. This makes the approval time stretch for as long as several weeks or even months. The demanding protocols and the uncertainty of approval consequently make Nigerians neglect obtaining loans from commercial banks.

But this problem birthed the emergence of digital lenders within the country (otherwise called LendTech) that provide quick lending services. With their services becoming popular, Nigerians can now get quick access to loans from the comfort of their home. The LendTech companies give liquid cash, within the range of 1,000 Nigerian Naira (2.18 USD) to 500,000 Nigerian Naira (1089 USD), and expect that the loan is paid within the agreed-upon period with interest.

It is critical to point out that they develop a credit score system used for reviewing the creditworthiness of a loan applicant. This credit score cannot however be used for getting a product on credit in the market or getting a payment plan when buying a product. Thus, Nigerians’ purchasing power is mostly limited to the liquid cash they possess. 


## How Loan Companies Operate

Digital loans in Nigeria are accessed through the mobile applications of the loan company. As a user, you’d need to download the app, sign up, fill in the onboarding form, and request a loan. The time for requesting a loan and getting approval is typically within 24 hours, except in the event of an unforeseen clarification.

Ideally, these loan companies are required to be registered by the federal government before they can offer their services. However, there still exists a large number of unregistered loan companies that operate unabated. Both registered and unregistered companies have their perks and downsides.



* **The Registered Lending Companies**

As of today, the [Federal Government of Nigeria has registered 94 digital lenders](https://nairametrics.com/2023/01/23/loan-apps-fccpc-approves-94-companies-as-digital-money-lenders/) with 49 having full approvals and the remaining 45 with provisional approval. These loan companies are typically more professional in their operation, They however may have a more stringent procedure before the loan requests are approved. Furthermore, interest rates are usually double digits ranging from 15% to 22% per month. 

When a borrower seeks a loan from these apps, they would need to fill in their personal details alongside the National Identification Number (NIN) and the bank verification number (BVN). The NIN is a unique ID that stores the details of all citizens of the country. The loan companies use the NIN to verify the details provided are accurate. The BVN, on the other hand, is a unique ID for all bank account holders that allows banks to share synchronized information about their customers. Hence, a person cannot open bank accounts in different banks using different details. The BVN helps digital lenders share information about a borrower’s default history and credit score. Most times, the borrower is required to provide their salary range and bank statement to gauge the limit of loans they are qualified for.

Equipped with this information, digital lenders provide quick loans with no guarantor or collateral. Should the borrower pay up before the agreed time, they would be qualified for a higher loan in the future. If a borrower defaults, they are usually given a grace period of 1 to 3 days, after which the initial interest begins to increase.

In cases where the borrower does not pay up in time, these registered companies engage debt recovery companies to recover their funds. 



* **The Unregistered Lending Companies**

A quick search for loan apps on Google Play Store returns a long list of alternatives. While some are under the aegis of regulatory bodies, many others are not. These unregistered digital lenders provide loans truly, however, they are culprits for flagrantly ignoring regulatory requirements, anti-money laundering, and data protection provisions.

After downloading these apps, the user will be required to grant permission to their contact, messages, media, and camera. In a [report by Tech Hive](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/C4D1FAQH3a4UlFHRsYQ/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1620351441585?e=1675900800&v=beta&t=ucpAXYSZTYcWyNdYv3jlYUR1zqbrft481v53VY9_qT8), 64% of these apps do not prompt the user to read and accept their terms of service. After granting these permissions, a loan request can be made and granted. Usually, the loan amount granted is less than the registered counterpart. On top of that, the interest rates are generally higher. A friend told me he was once told he was asked to give a 50% interest in a 7-day payment period. 

The loan company’s noncompliance with regulations means they can exploit users’ data as they wish and even sell data for personal gains. In the same report by Tech Hive, 65% of these apps use embedded ad trackers, and 24% use dark patterns within the apps, whilst not informing the users of their existence. There is also no clear option to opt out of these services. 

The impact of these privacy concerns is made crystal clear when a borrower defaults. The digital loan companies resort to embarrassing the borrower, first through derogatory SMS texts and phone calls. They go beyond that to send abusive texts to all contacts of the borrower, tagging them as chronic debtors and criminals. In some cases, they go as far as making defamatory statements about the person on social media. This recovery model violates the data protection rights of users but is still quite rampant amongst unregistered digital loans.


## The Impact of Digital Loan Companies on Standard of Living

In [this study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13540v1), the authors attempted to measure how instant loans can improve the well-being of Nigerians. They created two groups from a sample of 1618 borrowers for A/B testing. The first group would get automatic approval of their loan requests, while the other group would maintain the standard procedure before the application gets approved. Secondly, applicants whose applications were approved get a random maximum initial amount between 1000 Nigerian Naira (2.18 USD) to 13,000 Nigerian Naira (28.31 USD). The results from their study show that instant digital loans improve the subjective well-being of applicants by 0.281 standard deviations. The well-being was measured by an applicant's measure of depression and self-reported life satisfaction. In addition, those who are without jobs and those with a lower credit score derive even more satisfaction from the instant credit. They also found out that individuals who had the auto-approval feature had a 37% increase in the tendency to take out more loans. 


## Outlook for the Future

Without a doubt, there is a clear demand for digital credits in the Nigerian market. Digital lenders are also growing in numbers but the system is still riddled with challenges such as poor privacy protection, high-interest rate, and the risk of bad debt by defaulters. 

The Federal Government of Nigeria is however trying to protect privacy within the space by monitoring the activities of digital lenders and sanctioning non-complying actors. In 2019, an online lending platform, [Soko Loans was slammed with a 10 million naira sanction](https://nitda.gov.ng/nitda-sanctions-soko-loan-for-privacy-invasion/) by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) for data privacy infringement. 

Holistically, the prospect for the digital loan industry in Nigeria looks promising. Some platforms such as FairMoney, PalmPay, and Opay, have gone beyond just being loan providers to becoming digital banks. They offer banking services such as creating savings accounts, making payments, issuing ATM cards, investment opportunities, and so on. They also pay loan approvals into the bank account created for them, ensuring the borrower uses their banking services.
