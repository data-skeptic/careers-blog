# AI in Content Creation

In the 21st century, content is king. But if you have ever written a social media post, a meeting report or a blog post, you’d agree that creating content can be a hassle. Like in other fields, artificial intelligence has tremendously grown in the content creation space over the past few years. Today, writing content can be less stressful given the many AI tools at our disposal.

This article will discuss how artificial intelligence has influenced content writing. You’d discover AI tools that can significantly up your writing game and what the future looks like for creatives. Let’s begin with something fascinating.

## OpenAI’s GPT-3

On 11th July 2020, OpenAI announced the release of GPT-3. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a powerful AI model used to perform natural language processing tasks. To train the model, the AI tool crawled billions of pages of text online, to the tune of over 45TB in size. There were 175 billion training parameters, giving the model a high level of complexity. GPT-3 can Copywrite landing pages, write blog posts, answer open-ended questions, summarize text, translate language, compose a song and so on.  GPT-3 also boasts of converting natural language to code in different programming languages. 

Using the GPT-3 API for writing requires only simple commands of your intention. You input some texts as a prompt and the model completes the text based on the learned context. As found in their documentation, if you give the API the prompt, “write a tagline for an ice cream shop”, for instance, GPT-3 can return “we serve up smiles with every scoop”. How ingenious!

Although GPT-3 is not publicly available for free, developers can make use of their APIs to access the power of the GPT-3 engine. Today, numerous AI tools harness the GPT-3 engine for specific NLP use cases, some of which will be discussed in this article. 

If you are looking to personally use GPT-3, however, there is an open source version, called GPT-Neo, that mirrors the potential of GPT-3. Note that it is not as powerful as the paid version of GPT-3 Davinci (GPT-3’s most advanced version).

If the whole idea of GPT-3 looks intangible, let’s see practical AI tools widely used for content writing today.

## The Big Picture

From all that has been said, the question is, what can’t AI do? With the arrival of GPT-3, the capabilities of AI in content writing seem never-ending. Some people believe AI will eventually take the place of writers. 

While the advancement of AI is unquestionable, there are a few things that it cannot. For instance, to date, no AI system has successfully passed the Turing test. In the context of content writing, it means humans can still notice something off about content written by AI. In addition, it is believed that an AI system cannot write something new. It only rewrites existing content. Putting it simply, AI cannot match the creativity and ingenuity of human writers.

## Conclusion

This article has discussed the achievement of AI in content creation. We spoke about the powerful GPT-3 model and other AI tools used for content creation today. Given the foregoing, the notion that AI can potentially replace human writers is becoming more concrete. Although such thoughts are understandable, their actualisation is still far-reaching.
